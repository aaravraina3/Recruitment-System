Unlike other clubs focused on only building projects or competitions, Generate allows members’ work to empower startups and their founders.  What excites me most is the chance to apply and expand my skills in a setting where my work matters to real stakeholders, not just in the classroom or for a portfolio. Previous Generate projects have deeply inspired me, such as Ben Petrillo’s PlateMate. PlateMate exemplifies how Generate teams are able to not just extract analytical insights, but make impacts on stakeholders. Seeing these projects makes me think about where I could make a difference. For example, I’d love to enhance PlateMate’s analytics by leveraging my RAG experience, such as using textual data from menus and nutritional information to provide more concise dish performance insights.  My experience at myTickets building their own website’s chatbot from scratch has taught me the importance of collaborating creatively under time sensitive conditions to design practical data systems while maintaining clean products for users. Being able to spot where my skillset fits in, and the opportunity to collaborate with driven members are what makes me eager to join Generate. ","I’m confident in my abilities in LLM integration and RAG pipeline development. These are skills I’ve developed through all of academic projects, personal projects, and professional experience.  I’ve built a comprehensive retrieval system using Ollama, ChromaDB, and MongoDB, comparing multiple embedding models to optimize retrieval effectiveness, resulting in a RAG pipeline able to answer questions about academic class content. At myTickets, I worked as a Machine Learning Intern to prototype and build a multi-agent chatbot, allowing for ticket marketplace event recommendations through both natural language input, past user activity, and other user metadata. The skill I'm eager to develop is real time data infrastructure and streaming analytics. At myTickets, we realized without real time data infrastructure and streaming analytics by using technologies like Kafka, our recommendation system couldn’t adapt to our users preferences nearly as quickly. While I have a basic understanding of Kafka to enable real-time processing for pipelines, it’s something I’ve seen the importance of first hand, making me want to master Kafka and real time data infrastructure. Seeing the importance of incorporating new technologies, even if they are unfamiliar to me, is the driving factor that motivates me to learn new things and tackle challenges.","Learning about algorithms, both in CS3000, and exploring them on my own time, was a transformative experience, shaping the way I view my work now. Previous to exploring algorithms and topics such as dynamic programming, computer science and data science felt like two separate domains with little in common, with one focused on optimizing code and programming, and the other on extracting data insights. However, studying algorithms has shown me how deeply interconnected the two are.  	Studying dynamic programming served as a great reminder of the power of breaking down problems into smaller, easier problems. On a more technical note, graph algorithms showed me the structure behind data retrieval, a topic I later used while building RAG pipelines in a different class. Learning about searching and sorting, breadth first search, depth first search, and the general topic of time complexity allowed me to see how algorithms and their efficiency can unlock new data analysis methodology.  	These algorithms topics all combined to allow me to think from different perspectives than before. Unlocking the computational, algorithmic approach to data problems has resulted in me building more efficient, scalable solutions and taught me how influential interdisciplinary studies can be.  	","Working in both a technical professional role at a startup in myTickets, and a totally different professional role in retail operations at Nordstrom as a Logistics Processor has given me a unique dual perspective on what makes teams successful. I enjoyed a less structured role at myTickets, discussing and collaborating in a fast paced setting across interdisciplinary teams. On the other hand, at Nordstrom, I helped facilitate a tried and true inventory system amongst several store departments, whilst collaborating with each department manager to ensure store operations could continue.  In both roles, I’ve experienced how strong communication and support amongst group members are key to successful teams. Additionally, I’ve gained the understanding that great teams, like those at Generate, are built on a willingness to learn from one another, unite around a clear mission, and adapt to new challenges together. My contrasting experiences working with diverse groups of people gives me confidence that I can contribute to Generate and its teams not just on a technical level, but also with a clear communication and growth mentality that allows us to reach our end goal of creating valuable products for our startup partners.

The opportunity to work with real clients spanning across fields such as education and healthcare is something that not just something that excites me, but truly allows me to be a part of something that has a genuine impact on these industries during a time of my academic journey where opportunities are limited. I feel as though I have made my impact felt at Northeastern so far through my involvement with the South Asian cultural club UTSAV as Freshmen Representative, and now Cultural Chair. However, I feel it is also important that I use my technical and leadership skills to make my impact on the professional landscape here at Northeastern. The many teams and roles that compose Generate give the organization a “corporate-like” structure, which can prove to be invaluable going forward. As I can enter the CO-OP search and future job search, Generate can give me a distinct advantage that so few have in this field that continues to grow more and more competitive.","The technical skill that I feel most confident in is my understanding of the programming language SQL and database design. Although I have only started exploring SQL this summer, I have quickly gained a strong understanding of the language and everything that it has to offer. Databases are the backbone of many web applications, including one that I am currently building. One thing that I would like to continue to build on would be my understanding of the many different Python libraries. I understand that a large portion of the data team for Generate operates through Python, and while I have a very strong understanding of it, I would like to expand my knowledge of the intricacies within Python. The thing that drives me the most to learn is the constant feeling that I don’t know enough. That feeling brings out the hunger to learn more, to keep pushing myself, and to keep competing in this field that is only getting more and more competitive. I have always had a slight feeling of imposter syndrome, so my immediate response to that has always been to push myself and work even harder.","The biggest way that my past professional and extracurricular experiences have shaped me was as a leader. Leadership was not something I ever sought, nor was it something I was always comfortable with; however, it was a position that I was immediately thrust into as a 9th grader when I was named captain of the Shaker Varsity Tennis team. As a middle schooler and youngest state-qualifier, my prowess on the tennis court gained me all kinds of individual accolades; however, it contributed to very little team success. Previously, when I was a player, I got to observe the way previous captains went about leadership and dealing with situations. The biggest thing I took from them was that I should never ask anything of my teammates that I am not willing to do myself. In order to bring the best out of everyone around me, I needed to show that I was also willing to put in the hours myself. I truly believe that the best approach to leadership is leading by example and uplifting everyone around you. With this type of approach, not just overall performance, but the team environment also continues to grow stronger.","Although he might not be a public figure, Professor Mark Fontenot has been very influential in my early journey into data science. Prior to this Summer, I had minimal data science background aside from the work that I had previously done in Python; however, this summer I was really able to explore data and database management through Professor Mark Fontenot. His teaching style was truly engaging and allowed me to understand the ways in which data can be used to be the backbone of projects. This understanding was also complemented by the work I had done in Seattle with Amazon Web Services and their cloud platform. Professor Fontenot helped strengthen my understanding of the cloud and Amazon Web Services platform to serve as a cloud container if I ever wish to scale my project that I am currently working on.","I appreciate the consideration, thank you for your time.","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=2d1f7f83-24cd-4e59-bed2-2a87066f2f0f","407d7095cec6ac36fc2275a3af66d8ff"

I’ve always been fascinated by the product development lifecycle and how entrepreneurial spirit brings the vision to life. Through my leadership roles with Scout and the Entrepreneurs Club, I’ve explored the various phases a product goes through from ideation to launch. Scout’s product design focus and E-club’s emphasis on ideation made me more curious about learning how data shapes a product at Generate. What draws me to Generate is its mission to not only build innovative products, but also to cultivate the growth of its members. I love that Generate gives students the chance to work directly with passionate and inspiring founders. We not only get to bring their vision to life, but also engage with their ideas and processes. In my experience organizing events for entrepreneurial focused clubs, I’ve met many founders who love working with students because of their creativity, energy, and new perspectives. The data scientist role is a perfect opportunity for me to grow my skills in developing data-driven insights in a collaborative and community oriented environment.","One technical skill I am confident in is data visualization. Through both my coursework in data science and my data analysis internship with NUview, I’ve learned how important it is to choose the right visual to represent trends and prompt deeper questioning. At my co-op, I created waterfall charts to classify results from an order booking optimization model. These visualizations helped stakeholders understand complex outputs in a clear and meaningful way that sparks conversations about pain points and creating operational efficiencies. I’ve come to appreciate how visualizations do more than present data, they tell stories that encourage the development of actionable insights. A skill I would like to improve is data modeling. I want to deepen my understanding of how to minimize bias and prevent overfitting, so that I can build models that are more than just accurate, but are impactful towards real-world applications. What motivates me most is the excitement of continuous learning. I enjoy developing skills that not only help explain the past and present, but also enable us to predict outcomes in the future. Making more accurate assumptions about the future is very valuable for long-term growth and success.","EDA is my favorite methodology because it consistently shapes how I approach problem-solving. When I first learned about EDA, I didn’t fully appreciate its importance until I began working with large datasets during my co-op. Especially in client-facing work, where accuracy and clarity are essential, EDA helps ensure that insights are both meaningful and aligned with the client’s goals. I found that datasets being used in industry often come from multiple sources and require joining databases with many fields. This process is often prone to inconsistency errors in naming conventions or data types. I’ve learned that rushing through EDA often results in longer completion times and misleading results. EDA helps uncover issues such as missing values, data type mismatches, and outliers early. What I value most about EDA is that it’s not just cleaning the data, you are also understanding the data throughout the process. By validating assumptions and exploring the structure of the dataset, I can make better decisions about which fields to use and validating my results. It saves time in the long run and is a foundational step for any modeling or analysis that follows.","Though I haven’t been in Generate before, my professional and extracurricular experiences have helped me develop the collaborative, curious, and impact-driven qualities that I am excited to bring to the Generate team. During my co-op at Wayfair, I am working with the CastleGate Forwarding team that specializes in international shipping solutions for e-commerce. I am using Looker Studio and BigQuery connections in Google Sheets to build dashboards that track logistics processes, contract pipelines, and key business metrics. These dashboards support weekly business reviews and help streamline decision making. This experience continues to show me the significance of agile and iterative approaches in data analysis, where each version of a script or dashboards brings new insights and improvements. In my operations internship at The Community Preservation Corporation (CPC), I built and maintained a CRM system, which deepened my understanding of how data infrastructure supports long-term relationship management and business needs. In my data analysis internship with NUview and the Aspire Institute, I gained more experience with using raw Excel data to calculate engagement metrics that helped inform programming and long-term strategy with alumni. I’m excited to contribute these skills to Generate’s mission and collaborate with passionate members to build products that matter.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=7cb3e2e0-9e31-45b4-8999-dd88e2026acf","ae69b96f294b46656ee2dde730df74e1"

As a combined Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology major, I’m excited by how Generate brings together students from hardware, software, data, and design to collaborate on real-world problems. It’s one of the few organizations on campus where I feel like I can apply all facets of my academic background—whether through technical implementation or understanding user needs. I’ve seen the value of client collaboration firsthand through my internship at Leidos, where I worked directly with clients to understand and meet their needs. That experience taught me how important it is to balance technical skills with clear communication and adaptability. Beyond the work itself, I’m drawn to the community. I have friends who have stayed with Generate throughout their time at Northeastern not only because of the ability to learn, grow and work on new projects each semester, but because of the people in Generate and the community. I’m eager to contribute to and learn from such a driven, diverse team, and to continue growing both technically and personally in a space that values curiosity, impact, and collaboration.","One technical skill I’m confident in is working with relational databases using SQL. I’ve used it extensively in both academic and professional settings to organize and query complex data structures. At Cambridge CARES, I used PostgreSQL to manage time series health data and connect it to a real-time mobile UI. This experience strengthened my ability to design scalable and efficient data pipelines.  A skill I’m eager to improve is my proficiency with Python for machine learning and predictive analytics. While I’ve used Python for data cleaning and basic modeling, I want to deepen my understanding of advanced techniques and libraries. I’m especially interested in applying these tools to real-world data science problems.  What motivates me to keep learning is the desire to build innovative, high-impact solutions. At Leidos, I’m currently working on adapting large language models to detect and mitigate manipulation in digital environments. Tackling this challenge has shown me how quickly the field evolves—and how important it is to stay on top of the latest tools and research. I’m excited by the chance to keep growing so I can contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge, socially relevant projects.","One data science methodology I find really interesting is neural networks—especially recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are often used to model sequences like language or time-based data. As someone studying both Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology, I’m drawn to how these models mirror some aspects of human cognition, like memory and pattern recognition over time.  What I appreciate most about neural networks is how they evolve through feedback—constantly tuning and improving, much like how people learn through experience. That’s shaped the way I approach problem-solving: I try to think beyond just technical accuracy and consider how a system might align with how humans think, interact, and make decisions.  At Leidos, I’ve been working on projects involving large language models and behavioral modeling, and this idea of iteratively learning and improving has been central. Neural networks have pushed me to stay curious and open—to experiment, adjust, and keep asking questions. They remind me that data science isn’t just about building something that works—it’s about building something that adapts and grows, just like the people using it.","As a Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology major, I’ve explored diverse extracurriculars and professional experiences to blend my technical and interpersonal skills. Early on, I engaged in software development, tutoring, and research, each teaching me valuable lessons: building websites sharpened my collaboration and communication skills, tutoring deepened my empathy by seeing problems from others’ perspectives, and research emphasized teamwork and structure.  Last spring, I co-oped at Cambridge CARES in Singapore, developing a mobile app that tracks real-time health data. This role enhanced my software and data skills, working with time series data and databases, while also teaching me independence and cultural adaptability.  Currently, I’m interning at Leidos, where I work on data modeling and collaborate directly with clients like Intel to evaluate AI PC usability and emotional intelligence. This experience has strengthened my ability to communicate proactively and balance technical work with client needs.  Though my journey has been non-linear, it’s taught me the importance of empathy and clear communication alongside technical expertise—qualities I’m eager to bring as a data scientist at Generate.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=eaa97213-6e16-4271-bdd7-89275014dac5","efa3039444353fc06683bb7d57017c5f"

Generate’s mission of “empowering driven students through product development” resonates with me. Unlike other orgs on campus that focus on practice projects, Generate delivers actual solutions to real stakeholders allowing me to build solutions that have a genuine impact. A byproduct of creating such solutions is the satisfaction of seeing my work create measurable impact. The new data branch is also an exciting opportunity as data members get to help shape the direction of the branch. I believe my end-to-end data pipeline experience (integrating Salesforce and Snowflake into automated dashboards) positions me to contribute immediately while learning from Generate’s proven client delivery. The collaborative, feedback-driven approach particularly appeals to me as my experience working with stakeholders has taught me that the best data solutions come from understanding the context of your work, not just the technical implementation. I’m excited to bring my technical experience while growing alongside team members from different perspectives.","A technical skill I have developed and am confident in is end-to-end data solution design. During my co-op, I worked as a data engineer at Northeastern's College of Arts, Media, and Design. Here we found a trend of declining co-op placement rates since the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, my team found the need for analyzing placed student resumes to pinpoint the skills and experiences that were pivotal in getting placed. In the past, this would be a manual process requiring tens of hours to review hundreds of resumes, however, I was able to use Google's Gemini API to create a workflow which would automate this process. My pipeline automated four stages: data identification, resume extraction from NUWorks, Gemini-powered analysis, and roadmap visualization. The results of this project were highly actionable roadmaps that were distributed to the 2000+ students within the college. One technical skill I would like to learn/improve is MLOps and scalable model deployment. The resume review project gained interest from other colleges within Northeastern, but I lacked the infrastructure knowledge to easily scale the Gemini workflow across multiple institutions. I'm motivated to learn because I see the impact my work can have. My resume project directly helped 2000+ students better map their career paths. I'm also motivated because I enjoy understanding how complex systems work - I’m currently reading ""Why Machines Learn by Anil Ananthaswamy"" to understand ML foundations and build connections between technical implementations and their real-life counterparts. I am genuinely excited about applying the skills that I acquire to tackle challenges that I haven’t solved before.","My favorite influential figure in the data science field has to be Warren McCulloch. I recently read about McCulloch and Walter Pitts’ work regarding artificial neural networks. Their work back in 1943 laid the groundwork for AI/ML, a field I am deeply interested in understanding. McCulloch and Pitts took the logic of a real neuron and used mathematics to create an artificial neuron that could perform logical operations. This approach was ground-breaking at the time, but had its limitations, requiring hand calculations to work. Nowadays, through other scientists that built upon McCulloch’s work, we have artificial intelligence and machine learning. Their systematic approach of breaking down complex biological processes into simple mathematical components helped me understand how to solve problems better and I was even able to apply it to my current work. 	Currently, as part of an internship at Rigr.ai, an AI company working with law enforcement, I’m developing an NLP model that can predict user location based on their texts. This works by identifying language markers within user texts and determining user location from these markers. The technical challenge involves training models to recognize the subtle geographical language variations while maintaining accuracy across text sources. The model assists law enforcement in child safety investigations by providing location insights for more effective resource allocation. The architecture follows McCulloch-Pitt's thinking: simple processing units linked together to create sophisticated outcomes.","My professional and extracurricular experiences have shaped me into someone who values the impact and importance of my work in addition to technical detail. My co-op as a data engineer at Northeastern's College of Arts, Media, and Design had me working with data to help students. When we discovered declining co-op placement rates post-COVID, rather than diving straight into technical details, I first focused on understanding the problem. Working directly with coordinators and hearing from students experiencing these challenges, I created an automated resume analysis workflow that helped 2000+ students better understand their career paths. This collaboration taught me the importance of understanding problems from the source—the people actually experiencing them. Seeing my work have such a positive impact was incredibly rewarding and taught me that meaningful solutions require both understanding root causes and working systematically with diverse stakeholders to break complex challenges into manageable components. My extracurricular activities reinforced these values. Working with NUView to analyze Aspire Institute's alumni newsletter performance taught me how data-driven recommendations help organizations better serve their communities—a lesson I reinforced through Biokind Analytics, analyzing patient quality of life data for the Ellie Fund's breast cancer support services.

Of course, it is important to try and learn different skills as much as you can, I find it especially important to hone those skills through applied workshops or projects. I’ve always found it more interesting to master a topic through solving a problem as opposed to reading a book or solving a tedious workset. I’ve taken a look at the various projects that those at Generate have produced in the past, and grow eager. It is clear that Generate is the home of driven, focused students ready to make an impact on the world.  Data science and AI has grown and evolved at an exponential rate over the last few years. With startups rising at every corner of the world, I’m certain there are countless clients in Boston ready to work with a motivated group of students. And so, I grow excited thinking of the opportunity of working with talented peers on new products this year in the new data science branch. ","When applying to colleges, I hunted for buzzwords taht would make my application stand out. That led me to neural networks. The more I learned, the more fascinated I became (what especially caught my attention was how they are known as “black boxes,” like what do you mean we may never know all of what goes on in our models). Well, as I grew more adept in data science and machine learning I decided to take on a more challenging project. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that are especially effective with images. They learn to recognize complex patterns in data through convolutional and pooling layers through identifying features (edges, shapes, etc.). In my project, LungScan, I successfully implemented a custom CNN architecture that classifies histopathological scans of lung and colon tissues into five categories. My model achieved 95% accuracy on my test set. I feel that I’ve brought myself to a point where I’m fairly confident in my skill with implementing CNNs. One thing I’d like to improve upon is NLP. While we did learn basic NLP techniques in DS2500, I want to expand upon my skills in sentiment or text analysis. This would allow me to be able to tackle a broader range of problems.   My motivation to learn different data science and machine learning techniques / skills comes from a place of curiosity. AI has been growing at a rate that we never could have expected, and it shows no signs of slowing down. I want to keep up the pace with it, and I want to be at the forefront of it. I find the ins and outs of AI ever fascinating, and am fueled by the practical theory behind it and the application of it. ","Although he isn’t necessarily a data scientist nor is his content specifically related to data science, Grant Sanderson - the creator of the 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel - has been a major influence on my approach to data science. 3Blue1Brown is known for taking abstract mathematical concepts and demonstrating them in clear, intuitive ways. His animations have allowed me to wrap my head around concepts I struggled with. For example, his 8 video series on neural networks took my understanding to a different level. Being able to visualize how the model itself thinks and operates changed the way I approached developing my models. This mindset of visualizing before implementing continues to help my understanding of various topics and helps my ability to communicate different skills I’d learned. While I tend to use his videos more for math nowadays, I still look to visualize the models’ tendencies prior to developing it. ","This last semester, I participated as a mentor in ProjectML where I guided a group of 6 participants through a 3-week online program focused on building our participants a foundation in machine learning. Twice a week, I would guide students through data preprocessing techniques, different algorithms, ways to evaluate our models, etc. I didn’t immediately realize it, but by teaching my peers, I was able to better learn those topics myself.  After I was done teaching them the basics, I encouraged each of my students to choose their own dataset and work on it. I was there to guide them as they got stuck, but I really encouraged them to tackle their own obstacles before coming for assistance (also to not just use AI for the whole thing). One of my students kept seeing unexpected results from his model. Initially, I assumed we needed to change the model itself, but after trial and error, we found that the problem wasn’t actually with the model. The student had chosen a dataset about sentiment regarding COVID-19. He’d mapped his data to three different labels: “positive,” “negative,” and “neutral,” and the total count in ”neutral” was significantly fewer than in “negative” and “positive.” This skewed his results greatly. By taking a step back and deciding what we really wanted our model to predict (in this case positive and negative sentiments, not neutral) we were able to overcome the problem by dropping the “neutral” column.  This experience of mentoring fellow students humbled me, and taught me different ways to approach the problem. It is important to look at all the different facets of the problem as opposed to focusing on just one possible one.

While browsing clubs on Instagram this summer, Generate immediately stood out with the kind of work that was being done: real projects, real clients, and real impact. The new data team especially caught my eye because it lines up perfectly with what I want to do in college. There are a lot of clubs that help students grow, but Generate is different because it mirrors the kind of environment I eventually want to work in: cross-functional, fast-paced, and filled with people who are excited to build cool things. I’ve been learning data science independently this summer out of pure interest, but I know self-learning can only take me so far. I’m looking to take that next step by contributing to real projects, learning from others, and being pushed outside my comfort zone. Generate’s product-focused, collaborative environment is exactly what I’m looking for. Even as a freshman, I’m ready to contribute, absorb knowledge quickly, and grow alongside others who are serious about data and tech. I want to start building from day one, and Generate feels like the best place to do that.","One technical skill I’ve developed this summer is SQL. I’ve been practicing how to write queries, create tables, and understand how structured data is stored and accessed. It’s helped me better understand how data flows behind the scenes, especially during a small personal project where I built a system that takes input of what’s in my fridge and outputs recipe ideas based on what I could make at home. That project also made me realize how important Python is when working with data pipelines and logic. While I’ve touched Python a bit, I still have a long way to go, especially when it comes to using data-focused libraries like pandas. I’d love to improve in that area by working on real projects in a collaborative setting, where I can both contribute and learn from others. What motivates me most is the satisfaction of figuring something out after struggling with it. I enjoy problem-solving, even if it means making mistakes along the way. That “aha” moment after fixing a bug for the first time is what keeps me going. I also like the idea of building things that are useful or interesting to others. It makes the challenge feel worth it.","One of my favorite data science concepts is linear regression. It was the first algorithm I truly understood, and it helped me realize how simple tools can uncover valuable insights from data. I liked how it didn’t rely on anything flashy. It just drew a straight line through points and made a prediction based on that. That simplicity made data feel less intimidating and more approachable. Learning linear regression shaped how I think about problem-solving. It taught me that you don’t always need complex models or advanced techniques to get value out of data. What matters more is understanding the context and using the right tool for the job. That mindset stuck with me, especially during my fridge recipe recommender project. I tried not to overcomplicate things and instead focused on logic and structure first. As I continue learning, I try to build from that foundation: understanding the “why” behind each method, not just how to use it. I want to be able to make decisions that are both technically sound and practically useful, and linear regression was the first step in showing me how to think that way.","My past experiences have shaped how I learn, lead, and build. This summer, I worked on building a shoe recommendation project using AI. I initially had no clue how to build it, so I vibe-coded my way through while figuring out how to structure user data, use the GPT-4 API, and connect feedback to recommendation outputs. It gave me a better understanding of how data flows through a system. In high school, I was a project lead and PR director in our coding club, where I led internal tech projects and handled outreach. My favorite experience was competing in a NYC high school hackathon, where my team built a game using Python. I worked on the backend logic that tracked health, hits, and player status, and we made it to the top 5. These experiences showed me how much I enjoy working on real projects and figuring things out as I go. I like being part of a team, especially when everyone brings different skills to the table. I’m excited to take that to the next level at Generate where I can keep building, but in a more structured, product-focused environment with people who are just as driven.","As a freshman, I know I’m early in my journey, but I really believe I can thrive in Generate. Even if I’m not selected, I’d love to stay involved by shadowing, learning from members, or attending events.","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=2a1fad68-9deb-4188-a227-263dd751bd26","cd96207d6a46207e8d9514c387b651f8"

From watching Shark Tank as a kid to participating in a summer program at Babson College, I have always been inspired by the type of growth that entrepreneurship sparks. Entrepreneurship fosters a growth mindset that transcends technical expertise, and I am particularly drawn to Generate for their emphasis on growth and developing leaders in product development. From helping startups build their products from the ground up to assisting clients scale their ventures, this process involves an entrepreneurial mindset that thrives on empathy, adaptability, and innovative thinking. Generate offers the ideal environment for me to take on challenges that will sharpen my leadership abilities and inspire innovation. Being involved in these early-stage challenges is invaluable as it pushes me to continuously learn and grow. By aligning with Generate’s mission, I hope to not only hone my analytical skills but also make meaningful contributions to one day become a leader in the field of data science.","I am confident in my ability to analyze and visualize datasets using libraries in Python. In one project, I created word clouds from the top ten most active X/Twitter users on conversations about voice phishing and scam calls. Another project involved analyzing travel and tourism in the UK, where I uncovered key travel trends using line plots and box and whisker plots. I used bar carts to visualize the top countries UK residents like to visit and spend the most money at, doing the same analysis for overseas residents as well. Additionally, I worked with a moderation dataset from Maston where I built a similarity network to visualize moderation instances across the platform, color-coded by their respective moderation reason. While I am confident in my ability to work with Python, I am eager to learn SQL. I will be taking Introduction to Databases next semester, where I will be taught SQL. I’m excited to pick up this essential tool as efficiently managing large databases is very useful in data analysis. What motivates me to learn new things is my dislike for stagnation. The idea of staying the same person forever doesn’t resonate with me; I’m always looking to learn new skills and explore opportunities. This driven mindset is what pushes me to continuously improve and take on challenges.","One of my favorite data science methodologies is sentiment analysis. This technique can take text data and compute its sentiment score—whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral. This tool has been very helpful in several of my projects. In my project where I analyzed conversations about voice phishing and scam calls, I used sentiment analysis to gauge public perception. I find it fascinating how human emotions and behavior can be understood by just applying natural language processing to real-world data.","While I haven’t been involved with Generate yet, my experiences have shaped me into a highly driven individual. My most recent occupation was doing door-to-door sales, which I would’ve never imagined myself doing. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone, and I was able to develop many useful skills. I learned that sales is in conversation. While a physical product may not be sold, an idea might be. I have become a better active listener. Instead of listening to reply, I listen to understand. By being more present in conversations, I have been better at understanding individuals and picking up on body signals. Additionally, when I was having bad luck at work, I was forced to learn how to be adaptable. I had to understand what worked and what didn’t work for different neighborhoods. “Was it my icebreaker that was off, or did I not build enough value in the product?” I learned how to reflect on my performance and pick apart the positives and the work-ons.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=8a7082f9-e318-42c0-85d5-d018a8410adf","a27e128e17066af38431ff9b071b50b0"

There are teams for management, data, software, hardware, finance, marketing, and more, all working together like in an actual company. I think that’s incredibly valuable, because in real projects, code is just one part of the process. From past experience, I’ve learned that focusing only on development isn’t enough because there are so many other moving parts that can make or break a project. I really want to see how all the teams interact, how decisions are made and how ideas go from concept to execution. That kind of exposure is rare and hard to get in a classroom setting. And honestly, being around passionate, talented people who are building cool things is the kind of environment I’m looking for. I’ve seen posts on Instagram of community events and it feels like a team that works hard, and knows how to have fun, and I’d really want to be part of it.","One technical skill I’ve developed and feel confident in is web scraping. I used to do it a lot for personal projects just because I found it interesting to collect data from different websites. I liked figuring out how the site loads content, finding the right patterns in the HTML, and writing scripts using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract what I needed. At one point, I wanted to build my own large database of information for science olympiads with all problems, solutions, and files from all around the world. Back in school, I dreamed of going to IPhO (didn’t work out), so I just wanted to make something that could help future students access everything in one place. Databases are really something I want to get better at. I know the basics of SQL and how to connect and query, but I’d like to get better at designing, managing, and editing more complex databases. What motivates me to learn is pretty simple. I don’t want to live life with regrets. A while ago, I promised myself that I want to look back one day and feel proud of what I’ve done, and happy with how I got there.","One of the most interesting data science concepts I’ve explored is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I came across them while working on my Virtual Touch project, where I was building a gesture-based control system using a regular webcam. At first, I used color detection and contour tracking to detect hands, but the system broke easily with different lighting or slight changes in hand shape. I started looking into CNNs to solve this. I didn’t manage to fully integrate one, but learning how they extract features from images layer by layer helped me rethink my approach. Instead of manually tuning every rule, I began focusing on how to design systems that can generalize better from input data. It also pushed me to learn more about training models, preprocessing data, and how small visual details can change everything. ","I’ve been seriously trying to get into software engineering for less than a year. I’ve learned a lot and made solid progress, but I don’t feel like it’s enough to write a deep story about yet. So instead, I want to talk about something that’s been with me much longer: music. I’ve been playing guitar for the last five years, and other instruments before that. It’s always been a part of my life, so I tried to post my playing online as I thought I’m a solid player. But it was such a humbling experience. Not because people’d say something bad, but because I started hearing every tiny mistake I used to ignore. Notes slightly off, rhythm not quite right. I’d spend hours replaying the same few seconds, trying to make it sound clean. It was frustrating, but it taught me a lot. I realized real growth happens in the small details, and that doing something “well enough” is not the same as doing it right. That mindset is now what I’m trying to apply to all parts of my life. Not always successful, but well, I guess that’s how people grow.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=92341405-e091-43cf-849f-f80af864c582","49e6f4950e4c178fea9a9d8d2597eca2"

The opportunity to work on products and problems for actual startups is fascinating to me, as I haven’t seen another student-led group as in-touch with professionalism as Generate. Beyond the projects, what excites me most is the friendly and creative environment I’ve seen through current members, and Generate social media platforms. I look forward to building friendships outside of the classroom with people who share my passion for technology. I also hope to gain guidance from mentors in Generate, and in the future, I hope to mentor others and help them grow as well.","A technical skill I’m confident in is data visualization. Through high school programming classes as well as coursework and labs at Northeastern, I have developed strong skills in Python libraries such as Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I quickly adapt to new libraries and build on those that I already use. Additionally, my business administration combined major has helped me excel (no pun intended) in statistics and probability concepts that I use hand in hand with data visualization. A skill I would like to improve upon is machine learning and algorithm development. I will be taking a graduate course CS5800 (Algorithms) this fall, which I believe will strengthen my abilities and help me thrive in the Generate program. Surrounding myself with other like-minded generate members who have accomplished so much upon joining this group gives me the motivation to learn new things and take on challenges. As an extremely motivated person myself, I believe exposure to all opportunities, whether they turn out to be an interest of mine or not, helps give me the insight I need to make better decisions in the future.","My favorite influential figure in the field is Daliana Liu, a former Amazon Senior Data Scientist with seven years of experience in machine learning and data science. I discovered her podcast on Spotify last year, and although she wasn’t the most well-known figure, her motivation and drive to shape her career inspired me to keep listening. Daliana now works in coaching and content creation, sharing what she learned from navigating her career as a data scientist. She interviews data scientists, professors, CEOs, researchers, and so much more. My favorite episodes feature professors whose perspectives have influenced the courses I’ve taken and plan to take, as well as my point of view on certain career choices and pathways I plan to pursue. I also admire that she was director of her college drama club while earning her BS in Mathematics. As a former competitive dancer, singer, and actor, I relate to her. I believe “theater kids” bring unique experiences that benefit our professional lives. Learning to accept constructive criticism and direction from a young age has taught me to collaborate and approach feedback with grace and an open mind.","My extracurriculars and jobs have shaped my skills and mindset. In high school, I balanced sports, after-school clubs, volunteering, and two jobs, one in retail and one in food service, which taught me motivation, balance, and patience skills. I’ve continued both jobs through college, where I carried that patience I earned into my first year at Northeastern. I chose to go at my own pace, focusing on time management and figuring out what I wanted to accomplish during my years at school. This decision ultimately led me to want to join Generate. Over the past year, joining my sorority Kappa Delta and participating in religious clubs, which I hadn’t originally planned, showed me the value of stepping outside my comfort zone. In doing so, I discovered I’m optimistic, collaborative, and eager to help others. I want to join a group that contributes to my community and supports those around me, and I believe Generate is that group for me.

Generate's client-focused approach excites me most. Working on projects with real-world implications is rare, especially while taking classes and not on co-op. Compared to the clubs I’m currently in, I’m missing the broader impact in my work. Generate's combination of real client challenges and collaborative teamwork is exactly the kind of environment I want to be a part of. Many people forget Generate is more than just a computer science club, yet this is one of the most attractive parts of the club for me. Though I love my fellow CS majors, I believe working alongside members focused on the business side of things, people working to build real hardware, and creative minds focused on promoting Generate would broaden my perspective and make me a better problem-solver.","I'm most confident in my ability to quickly learn new technologies. As a rising sophomore, I've embraced every chance to work with new technologies. This varied exposure to diverse tech stacks has made learning routine. At Generate, I’m sure I won’t be 100% familiar with everything I would work with, and that excites me. Beyond this, I want to learn and improve my system design and architecture skills in collaborative settings. While I’m no stranger to building and working in teams, shipping a large scale production-grade system from scratch is something I can definitely learn from. Generate would be ideal for working in an industry-adjacent setting, as I’d collaborate with my team and really understand the inner workings of such a large scale project. Designing something huge from scratch is a learning experience I am ecstatic to take advantage of as I progress in my career. What motivates me is that feeling when it clicks, and something I made is working. It would only get better at Generate, seeing my hard work translate into functional solutions that create real impact for clients.","One methodology that changed how I approach my work is text vectorization, specifically TF-IDF. I first learned about it from a friend using it for an NLP project, and it opened up a new world of projects I could tackle. Before TF-IDF, I limited myself to projects with quantitative data, and didn't step into anything categorical. When I realized we could take categorical data and create meaningful numerical representations, I was surprised. I realized I could have employed this within my SHIELD project to improve analysis of threats. However, since I was satisfied with that project, I turned my attention to a new project I'm working on that uses RAG and text vectorization to provide accurate nutritional information for my gym journey. While I'm in the early stages, it's exciting to see how much TF-IDF enables. Knowledge in this methodology has been valuable beyond my own projects. I was able to help a friend who was having trouble analyzing unpredictable categorical responses in survey data. The concept of keeping track of a word's significance in an accurate numerical representation is extremely interesting, and is now my first instinct when I encounter messy data.","Though I haven't been in Generate before, joining has been a huge goal since meeting upperclassmen who excited me about the growth and learning opportunities here. While not in Generate, I’ve made sure to keep myself involved within our campus community to ensure I keep learning in (and out of) the tech space. As a software developer at TedXNortheasternU, I collaborate with our Tech team to build new components and features using React for our website. Additionally, we work on integrating Sanity to manage our content dynamically. Through TedX, I’ve been able to grow technically while also getting introduced to a team setting of college students. Furthermore, my research assistant position at the Movement Neuroscience Lab (MNL) has pushed me to work with unfamiliar technologies like C# and Unity, forcing me to adapt and find comfort in new waters. My strength in teamwork stems from my internship at WRE, where I was exposed to an Agile environment in a professional setting, allowing me to take those skills and apply them here in a college environment as well.

That’s what draws me to Generate. I’ve heard so much about how strong the community is, not just professionally, but socially. The idea of being part of a group where I can sit down for lunch with people who get excited about the same things I do, show up to events together, and build real friendships while working on meaningful projects. That’s exactly the environment I want to be in.   As someone applying for the data science team, I’m excited to contribute by analyzing data, building models, and uncovering insights that can help Generate make smarter, more informed decisions. I look forward to working on projects that improve how the organization understands its impact and optimizes its resources. I see this role as a chance to grow my technical skills while supporting a team and community I respect.   Generate’s value that stands out most to me is intentionality. I admire how Generate doesn’t just do things to check a box, but approaches every task with purpose and thoughtfulness. That mindset, combined with the kindness and inclusivity I’ve heard so much about, makes Generate feel like a place where I can grow both professionally and personally.","One technical skill I feel confident in is writing clean, well-organized Java code. I’ve spent a lot of time learning how to structure my programs in a way that’s modular and maintainable, and I really enjoy the logic behind object-oriented design. It’s the kind of work that feels satisfying when everything fits together just right.   Something I’m less confident in is web development. I recently built my first full website and taught myself JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and a bit of backend with Flask. It was a fun challenge, but I know I’m still early in that journey. There’s so much more I want to learn, especially when it comes to building dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.   What motivates me most is the feeling of turning something unfamiliar into something I understand and then actually getting to use it to build things that work. I like pushing myself out of my comfort zone, especially when I know the skills I’m gaining will help me contribute more to a team. Plus, nothing beats the moment when something finally runs after hours of trial and error.","One of my favorite algorithms is decision trees because they break down complicated problems into simple yes-or-no questions, kind of like how I approach decisions in real life. It actually reminds me of the Prisoner’s Dilemma we studied in microeconomics, where each choice depends on what you think the other person will do. Both require thinking step-by-step and anticipating different outcomes.   When I’m working on a project, whether it’s debugging code or organizing data workflows, I try to break the problem down into smaller pieces, just like a decision tree. For example, if something isn’t working, I ask myself questions like “Is this data clean?” or “Did this function run correctly?” Each answer guides me toward the next step. This way of thinking helps me stay organized and logical, and it also makes it easier to explain my process to teammates. It’s become a practical framework that shapes how I solve problems every day.","While I haven’t been in Generate yet, a lot of my growth has come from building things with people who care just as much as I do. Whether that’s designing a GUI for a marine robot in Northeastern Robotics or replacing an international nonprofit’s paper system with a clean Airtable dashboard. Each project taught me how to problem-solve in real-world contexts, communicate with both tech and non-tech people, and stay calm when things go wrong.   But beyond the code, what’s helped me grow the most is the people like the mentors, teammates, friends who made those experiences feel collaborative, not transactional. That’s what draws me to Generate. I want to build meaningful projects with people I can also grab a bagel with after a late-night bug fix. Growth to me is technical and personal, and I’ve heard Generate offers both in one very cool, very kind package.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=91284758-4528-4877-8e60-cc9a1bed5190","dd209e97d0555987e67fe3dd5c4614ca"

As a CS/Math major, I’m always looking for ways to apply technical skills to solve practical problems, and Generate’s mission aligns perfectly with that. In a past co-op, I worked on internal tools used by investment analysts and collaborated directly with them (the end users) to understand their needs. That experience showed me how impactful it is to build intentionally and iterate based on real feedback, which I appreciate is a shared value in Generate. What sets Generate apart is the emphasis on teamwork and culture. From my own past experience, I found it to be a space where people genuinely care about their work and each other, and that kind of environment pushes me to grow and learn which is an experience that I really value.","One technical skill I’ve developed and feel confident in is building data-driven backend tools (specifically in Python). During my past co-op at Wellington, I designed tools to automate data quality reporting and extend visualization dashboards in Tableau. I enjoyed the challenge of working directly with data and iterating based on user feedback to make meaningful & impactful improvements. One area I’m actively looking to improve is working with machine learning models in production. I’ve studied the theory and done some personal experimentation based on classwork, but I’m excited to deepen my understanding of how to build and deploy ML systems.","One of my favorite data science methodologies is data visualization, as a part of the analytical process instead of just the final step. Whether I’m exploring patterns or communicating insights, visualizations help make data clearer, more accessible, and ultimately more impactful in a way that is not always as effectively communicated through words. During my co-op at Wellington, I extended Tableau dashboards used by investment professionals, where clarity and precision were critical. These experiences taught me that not only do strong visualizations display information, but importantly, they tell a story, highlight what matters, and help users make important decisions. Visualization has shaped the way I approach problem-solving, as I now think more about how others will interpret and use what I build. ","As a Business Analyst on the Data Team in Fall ’23, I started internal dashboards that helped some of the hardware team track the materials cost/quantity. It was a great opportunity to apply both technical and analytical skills by cleaning and analyzing data, and building dashboards that made information more accessible. What made the experience especially meaningful was the culture. I found that Generate fosters a space where everyone is encouraged to take ownership while still learning from each other. It was very motivating to see how collaborative the teams were, and how open and friendly everyone was on an individual basis as well.","n/a","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=465acb89-c1b6-441d-a82b-6ee7ab8c1584","996ec21a4e32f36d43047cd5a699263f"

I am very much a product person, but I’ve really only worked adjacent to the products I've previously worked on. That includes: supporting infrastructure, building internal tools, or handling data. Never having the chance to directly own or build the user-facing solution. What excites me most about Generate is the opportunity to be at the forefront of product development, contributing to tangible outcomes that real startups and businesses rely on. I’m eager to be part of a community where I can collaborate and learn with some of the most passionate builders on campus, working to build meaningful human-centered solutions. I'd also like to add that seeing all the cool things students have build at the end of semester Generate showcases has been a big awe factor about this club! ","One technical skill I’m confident in is working with data; whether that’s transforming large datasets, building visualizations, or writing SQL queries. I enjoy making data easier to understand and consolidating to make it more useful for real decisions. A skill I’d love to improve is LLM prompting and learning how to work better with AI models. Since AI is becoming such a big part of the tech world, it makes sense to learn how to use it effectively instead of avoiding it. What motivates me to learn new things is the idea that there’s always a better or more creative way to solve a problem. I like having a growth mindset and trying things that push me outside of what I already know. Taking on new challenges gives me a broader set of experiences and helps me become a stronger and more adaptable builder.","One of my favorite concepts in data science is search algorithm (binary search, BFS, and DFS). I was fun learning them in CS3000, mostly because they were one of the few topics that actually made sense right away. Beyond just being fun, they are pretty applicable to everyday life. I remember joking with my friends on whether or not to use BFS or DFS for something completely non CS related. These algorithms have stuck with me because they can be a solution to solving things applicable to real life. Even outside of class, they’ve helped me approach things like research or exploring new ideas with a little more structure.","Having worked in both big tech and finance, I’ve developed a strong understanding of these environments. While their core goals are similar, the processes they use to reach them differ. Moving from finance to tech was a big culture shock because tech is more flexible and lenient as long as you get your work done. The “work hard, play hard” mindset really resonates with me and has inspired me to focus more on computer science than finance. Knowing both sides gives me a well-rounded view of what it takes for a business to succeed. Outside of work, I enjoy creative activities like painting, drawing, journaling, and reading, though I admit I spend some time on social media too. Growing up involved in the art world taught me the value of personal expression, which I try to bring into my academic and professional work. Ultimately, creativity is something I truly enjoy and value.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=78da8863-d4d3-48d8-b162-f9b7b5919ff6","9d00d7e380dcd271cafcca0396c9672e"

The premise of Generate offers the perfect environment to gain real startup experience. In my opinion, the best way to learn is by doing, and after hearing that the Data team will be completely client-facing this year, I know that it will offer opportunities that align with my goals far more so than many of the clubs on campus can offer. Having researched the previous projects listed on Generate’s website, I think it’s amazing that the work you do as a student makes a real impact on companies. Additionally, I noticed that some of the founders that Generate works with are Northeastern alumni, which offers another cool opportunity to work directly with people who were in the same shoes I’m in now. Having the ability to see how they are utilizing their Northeastern experiences to build their own startups is unique and is especially eye-opening given how much there is for me to learn.","A technical skill of mine is coding with Java, which I learned in my computer science class. Throughout the past year, I’ve utilized that skill on side projects such as a ski inventory system and an advising site. While I could improve my proficiency, I try to work with my current knowledge. I’d love to strengthen my SQL ability and improve my understanding of machine learning. The term is somewhat of a buzzword, and I want to gain knowledge about how it works rather than hearing about it while lacking understanding. When it comes to learning new things, my biggest motivator is knowing that the work I’m doing will benefit me in the future. I try to make decisions with my end goal in mind, so applying to join Generate is as much a decision about the immediate benefits as it is about the long-term ones. This also connects to my mindset regarding challenges. “Nothing good comes easy” is a motto that’s worked its way into many aspects of my life. Whether through my course load, extracurriculars, or hobbies, I’ve always sought out challenges. There’s something to be said for following through on your commitments and upholding that is an unwavering value of mine-even when it gets tough.","There is lots to learn about data science as a whole; however, this past year I took statistics, which gave me a little insight into what it’s about. One concept I found interesting was linear regression and the least squares method. Taking calculus simultaneously allowed me to learn the “why” and “how” behind the way certain things work-such as understanding that, to get the line of best fit, you are taking partial derivatives of the sum of the errors squared (essentially the first derivative test). Though I don’t consciously think about it, I do believe that style of learning influences my approach to problem solving. Being able to connect the dots between different sets of knowledge makes it easier to complete the whole picture. I would love to be able to speak more technically on what draws me to the Data team; however, I feel that being less familiar is why I wanted to get involved in the first place, and I’m hoping that will serve as a catalyst for my exploration into the field of data science. I’m confident in my ability to adapt and learn based on what’s asked and expected of me, especially when it comes to taking on new things.","Throughout high school, I prioritized partaking in diverse extracurriculars to become more well-rounded and gain insight into what I truly love doing. This taught me the importance of building skills outside your focus. Although you need strong technical skills to become a successful engineer, you also need to be able to communicate effectively, write professionally, and work with others. I aim to continually put myself into new experiences so that I can cast my net wider, which will in turn help me become a better engineer. While participating in clubs helped me grow, starting my own initiatives has impacted me more significantly. A great example is a computer camp I founded. Being responsible for the success of something is an entirely different experience from being a member, and that has given me a complete perspective on teamwork and commitment. It’s this leadership experience where my value of following through on commitments stems from. Having experienced the frustration when team members aren’t fully committed, I ensure I never sign up for something I can’t deliver on. I never want to be the team member who doesn’t pull their weight.","I just want to thank you again for your time and your help with answering my questions earlier this summer!","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=bb21a263-17f5-4975-90c9-41a4223805f7","dac3311537bb876fc1ac1cda3f326005"

In my past experiences where I was a leader for my peers I had a priority of allowing everyone to feel secure in a safe and growth oriented environment. As a newcomer in Generate, I can feel confident knowing that those who will be leading and guiding me will foster a similar environment allowing me to reach my full potential. I’m looking forward to experiencing that same kind of environment from the other side. Knowing Generate is built on these principles gives me assurance that I’ll be challenged and encouraged in the same way I have done for others.The Generate culture is the one I want to grow in and contribute to. ","I have developed Python through competitive programming(USACO and ACSL) and personal projects. One aspect I really enjoy about Python is the ease of use for manipulating data and machine learning in general. However, I would like to develop more front end skills such as Javascript through other projects to deploy more complex web applications that are full stack. This, and the idea of bringing my ideas and visions to fruition is what motivates me to learn new things and take on complex challenges. I would like the ability to actually create solutions that I want, and not just imagine them. That drive to keep building and improving is what keeps me excited about CS.","I really enjoy the theory behind predictive models because they transform raw data into clear takeaways. One approach that’s shaped my thinking is kernel density estimation, which I’ve applied in my NBA shot chart project. By visualizing shot locations and predicting scoring tendencies based on court zones, I’ve learned how powerful data can be when paired with the right tools. This project helped me to understand where a player is most effective and how shot selection impacts performance. It’s made me approach basketball with a more analytical lens and think critically about how to model data effectively. More broadly, it showed me how data science can connect deeply with personal interests, which makes the learning process even more motivating and rewarding. I believe that the most meaningful work happens when I can combine technical skills with the things I’m passionate about through creating solutions that are both insightful and interesting. ","I have been a TA for the Mathematics department at Northeastern since January and previously worked as a peer tutor throughout high school. These experiences have taught me how to communicate ideas clearly, collaborate effectively, and support the growth of those around me. Furthermore, my time spent on technical projects, whether collaborative ones like my Calendar project for Object-Oriented Design or more independent ones like my NBA shot analyzer, has allowed me to apply and deepen the technical skills needed for brainstorming and developing my ideas. These experiences have shaped me into someone who values both learning and sharing knowledge. I’ve come to appreciate how much more impactful and rewarding work can be when it’s done with others, whether it's debugging code or brainstorming new ideas. This mix of teaching, learning, and building has pushed me to seek out communities like Generate, where I can keep growing alongside people who share the same drive to create.","NA","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=0b425c1b-b97b-4ce4-aa0e-64d203140959","bdc929a1a39b6aeb75f7aa1ab2fd84df"

Most importantly, Generate's network connects me with like-minded entrepreneurs and the broader Northeastern startup community, providing mentorship and potential co-founders for my future ventures.","I'm most confident in building end-to-end data pipelines and analytics systems. Through projects like my European Soccer Scouting Platform and Biometric Payroll System, I've developed expertise in extracting, processing, and analyzing large datasets to create meaningful insights. I can architect complete data solutions—from web scraping and database design to implementing complex analytical logic that drives real business decisions. This directly aligns with Generate's Data team focus on building data solutions that ""tell stories and drive impact."" I'd like to strengthen my interactive dashboard development and data visualization storytelling. While I've built functional analytics using matplotlib and pandas, I want to master creating compelling, user-friendly dashboards that non-technical stakeholders can easily navigate. Given that Generate's Data team works on dashboards alongside machine learning models, I'm eager to learn tools like Tableau or advanced Plotly/Dash to build more intuitive data visualizations that help clients make informed product decisions. I'm driven by the opportunity to transform raw data into actionable insights that directly impact product success. What excites me most is seeing how data solutions can guide critical business decisions—whether helping a startup optimize their user acquisition strategy or identifying market opportunities through analytics. Generate's focus on working with real clients means my data work will have immediate, measurable impact on actual products and ventures, which perfectly matches my passion for entrepreneurial problem-solving.","My favorite data science methodology is the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, which has fundamentally shaped how I approach every project. CRISP-DM's six-phase cycle of business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment ensures I never jump straight into building models without first understanding the actual problem I'm solving. This methodology was crucial in my European Soccer Scouting Platform project. Instead of immediately scraping data and building algorithms, I first spent time understanding what scouts actually need: identifying undervalued players, not just the highest performers. This business understanding phase led me to focus on market value discrepancies rather than just statistical excellence, making the final product far more valuable. The iterative nature of CRISP-DM has also taught me that data science is rarely linear. In my trading algorithm project, I cycled back from evaluation to data preparation multiple times when I realized my initial feature engineering wasn't capturing market volatility effectively. This framework taught me that ""failed"" iterations aren't setbacks but essential steps toward better solutions. What I love most about CRISP-DM is its emphasis on deployment and real-world impact, not just model accuracy. This aligns perfectly with Generate's mission of building products that drive actual business outcomes. The methodology ensures I'm always thinking about how my data solutions will be used by real people to make real decisions, which is exactly the mindset needed for Generate's client-focused approach.","My professional and extracurricular experiences have shaped me into someone who thrives at the intersection of technical problem-solving and real-world impact. Early on, through projects like my Biometric Payroll System, I learned that the most elegant technical solutions mean nothing if they don't address actual business needs. Building a system to eliminate manual errors and save administrative time taught me to think beyond code and consider how end users would actually interact with my systems. This mindset was reinforced during my internship at Sourceware in Mumbai, where working on AI Agent integration for their E-Procurement product deepened my understanding of enterprise-level problem-solving. The experience showed me how technical decisions ripple through entire business processes and user workflows. What's shaped me most is learning to balance technical ambition with practical constraints. During my trading algorithm project, I initially built an overly complex system that looked impressive but was unreliable in practice. This taught me that sustainable solutions often require simplicity and robustness over sophistication. My experiences have also reinforced my belief in collaborative problem-solving. Whether working with teams at Sourceware or getting feedback from potential users of my projects, I've learned that the best solutions emerge from diverse perspectives and iterative improvement.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=1d7ff673-f6c8-47f8-9eab-0d8517bd5d86","7bbbb73f96af53ebef06935d764fa745"

I have always been interested in how Generate encourages students to work on projects that have real, meaningful impact. I have been looking for a data focused space where I can grow technically while implementing my interests, and now that Generate has a Data Science branch, this feels like the perfect fit. I am especially interested in learning from peers with different skill sets while contributing my own background in data. In this role, I look forward to using my technical skills to help organize information, improve systems, and support work that makes a meaningful difference. ","One technical skill that I have developed and feel confident in is working with structured data. Specifically cleaning, organizing, and preparing it for analysis or visualization. I have applied this skill in class projects and am currently using it during my co-op. In one class, I created a website that featured air pollution data visualizations in India. Throughout that project, I helped clean up data and use it to create meaningful visualization to portray the issue. This experience, along with my co-op work, has helped me understand the importance of clean and usable data in making systems more impactful.  One skill I would like to improve on is automation, specifically using Python to reduce repetitive tasks. Although I do have experience using Python, I definitely want to improve my ability to use it efficiently in this context. I believe automation is a great way to ensure time is used effectively and systems run more smoothly. ","An area of data science that has influenced my approach is data visualization, especially tools like Tableau. While working with Tableau, I have learned how important layout, interactivity, and thoughtful design choices are in helping the user explore data effectively. It has made me much more intentional when thinking about how to organize and present information. This is a mindset I bring into my co-op as well, where I consider carefully how colleagues will navigate and interpret the information we share. It has helped me realize that effective data work is just as much about interpretation as it is about analysis.","Although I have not been part of Generate before, my co-op so far and extracurricular experiences have shaped how I approached collaboration, systems, and problem-solving. Over the past month, I have been working on a dashboard to organize data across multiple teams. This has taught me how to build internal tools with usability in mind. I have learned the importance of asking good questions, designing for accessibility, and thinking from the users point of view. Outside of this, I have been involved in Phi Sigma Rho, which has helped me understand the value of thoughtful community-building. Helping with recruitment gave me experience in event planning and feedback collection, skills that connect closely with Generate’s internal operations and culture. Together, these experiences have pushed me to be more intentional, detail-oriented, and curious about how systems can better serve better and make an impactful difference.

I’m excited to deepen my knowledge in data management, visualization, and analysis and to apply my skills in real-world settings where I can see the tangible impact of my work.  From developing a centralized student platform to helping secure $134M in funding for UNICEF, I’ve seen how data can be a powerful tool for impact. While I’ve been involved in various facets of Mosaic, Generate uniquely enables me to bridge my classroom learning with work that supports not only entrepreneurs, but also the people they serve. The Eatwell dashboard I built directly supported better meal planning and procurement for families facing food insecurity and chronic health patients. I'm driven by this ability to create thoughtful data solutions- through feedback, iteration, and collaboration- that meet real, life-changing needs.  With my skills in Python, Tableau, machine learning, and Looker, I’m excited to take on more complex challenges- from integrating AI into our workflows to making ML-based predictions. Additionally, I am eager to continue contributing to a team in an uplifting and inclusive way. To me, Generate is a place to grow, build boldly, and make work that truly serves people.","One technical skill I’ve become confident in is designing dashboards that help people actually understand and use their data. Through my work at Generate, Liberty Mutual, and WISE, I’ve created visualizations in Tableau, PowerBI, and Looker that supported everything from patient data to team development. At Liberty, I built a dashboard from scratch in PowerBI that helped the internal audit team cut the analysis of closed issues by 60% and set optimal goals. At WISE, I designed a dashboard to track learning outcomes in our WeInvest cohort, where we saw confidence in VC rise from 30 to 90%. That dashboard helped introduce a new VP of Data role, which now keeps that insight loop going. I love being able to take something messy or abstract and turn it into something clear, visual, and useful.  I'd love to learn more about deep learning. I’ve worked with models before, but I want to go deeper into tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch and creatively apply them- maybe automating data analysis or exploring AI/UX intersections.  What motivates me is curiosity. I love learning across disciplines and connecting the dots. I embrace feeling challenged, sharing ideas, and pushing what I know. For me, growing as a person means growing in all directions. I aim to carry that energy into everything I build.","One influential figure shaping how I approach AI and data science is Lucy Guo, co-founder of Scale AI. In her early twenties, she helped build the infrastructure powering how labeled data is used at scale by companies like OpenAI and Meta- showing me that impactful data work isn’t just about insights, but also can be powering entire ecosystems to function.  Her design-focused mindset, combined with her tenacity, rigor, and determination, motivates me to advocate for both my ideas and myself. I admire how she identifies pain points quickly and isn’t afraid to build fast, fail, and pivot. Before DoorDash existed, she prototyped a similar idea at a hackathon, started a company, and failed! But she didn’t stop. That “just do it” mentality, guided by data and detached from ego, has shaped how I approach problem-solving and experimentation. I'm unafraid to experiment, test, fail, redesign, and rebuild- I enjoy it!  As someone concentrating in entrepreneurship and working within NEU’s venture ecosystem, I’m especially inspired by her Y Combinator journey and product-first mindset. At Generate, I try to channel that same energy- designing data solutions that are human-centered, scalable, and adaptable, while keeping a strong foundation in technical quality and real-world application.","After studying abroad and changing my major to data science, I felt behind. I didn’t know anyone in my classes, and tech felt intimidating. Although I was eager to grow my skills, I was lost.  That changed when I attended Generate’s spring showcase. I was blown away by the creativity, ambition, and sense of community in the room. The high-energy environment felt like home- a perfect balance between my passions for entrepreneurship, data science, and impact. I reached out to the director right away, eagerly waited for applications to open, and joined the team that spring.  Through Generate's mentorship program, I was paired with Elizabeth, and despite knowing me for only a few weeks, spent her lunch break mock-interviewing me for my co-op, which I earned shortly after. Her genuine investment in my success gave me confidence and reflected to me the heart of Generate: thoughtful, intentional, and empowering people.  In just a year, Generate has not only shaped me as a data scientist but also how I show up as a teammate, problem-solver, and leader. From the team bondings to the working sessions, Generate showed me that tech doesn't have to be cold. In a period where AI and technology have become more disconnected from humanity than ever, Generate demonstrates the opposite: in order to create meaningful impact, you need real community- empathy, creativity, and teamwork are at the root of progress and growth. It is this reason that Generate means so much to me, why I'd love to continue growing in this space, and above all, give back to Generate.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=66b40191-5a1c-47ac-9d57-3fd2d8f68103","f0163a7761fbbb0bc903ce7a29eb8924"

It's the reason I enjoyed being in Electric Racing, because from all the personal effort and went in to that club, I could see that I was working on something larger than myself and that was manifested in the car. While I realize there won't be such a physical identifier of our work bearing fruit at Generate, it still excites me to work in a team setting like this.","A technical skill I'm confident in is optimizing computing power through various techniques, like simulated annealing, evolutionary computing, and simply parallelizing. It's something I learned in an academic setting, then had to quickly put into practice and kind of teach myself on the job at my internship. A skill that could use some work is definitely data visualization for me; usually visualizations I make are just a bit too cluttered or not engaging enough. There is a certain art to it and I'm still trying to get the hang of it. I think what motivates me to learn new things is simply being confused and trying to teach myself new interesting techniques to solve a problem in a novel way.","I'd say Alan Turing is one of the most influential figures in the field of Data Science. This quote really sticks with me, “We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.” I'd say, while it applies to a much higher level than just my own problem solving, it influences how I work in that while I might not see the full picture, it's always clear the breadth of the work needed to get anything done.","I haven't been in Generate before, but my professional experiences have heavily shaped me into being an almost perennial and quick learner. While working at AbbVie, I had to pick up, pretty much on the job, how to use MATLAB, how to work with computing clusters, and just a lot of pharmacology and physics, which really weren't part of my coursework. I remember reading a great deal of research papers on drug release models and elementary fluid dynamics just so I could better understand what I was modeling. I'm also interning there this summer, and a similar theme is emerging, since this time I'm working with the team on protein language models, for which I've had to pick up new skills and methodologies like federated learning and working with heavy class imbalances.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=c2098a12-d30d-4ac2-9a96-91029588e427","43d6f0f847d3487eb280609b83c97bdd"

Generate provides a golden opportunity to get involved with real, high impact products. Especially in the scope of data science, which no other extracurricular at Northeastern involved with making client-partnered products emphasizes like Generate has started to. I became fascinated with getting more involved with data science after taking Machine Learning 1 last semester, and falling in love with the content, and I would love to marry my fascination with the field with the opportunity to create tangible, helpful solutions. I have also heard first hand accounts from friends who have been and continue to be involved with Generate who speak highly of the community and emphasis on friendship Generate fosters. Especially seeing the instagram takeovers and the events you put together, I look forward to creating a connection with people equally as passionate about the things I am. ","Over my various roles- working at my current coop on third party integrations, developing with the Notion API as the Director of Software at E-Club, and my involvement at hackathons- I feel confident and comfortable in my ability to implement backend solutions and working with RESTful API endpoints. I find backend engineering to be the most satisfying part of programming: seeing live data transferred and understood by programs because of the ingenious standard of HTTPS network protocols is like seeing the cogs in a machine turning. Exploring first hand how it worked in large scale projects is what drew me in and excited me to understand it more. In that vein, I have come to realize that transferring data is just part of it: understanding it is even more important. I would like to explore more in the field of ETL pipelines; about how convert and construct that data into something even more impactful and palatable, and the unique challenges that come with working with large data sets. After taking Machine Learning 1, I have gained a new appreciation for the beauty of machine learning algorithms, and crave to see the satisfaction of it working with a real world impact.","Decision trees have always stood out to me as an elegant solution to a complex problem. After taking Machine Learning 1 and straining to understand the fascinating but admittedly complex solutions many algorithms are based on, decision trees were like a light in the darkness. Granted, understanding the math behind entropy and information theory took weeks to fully understand, but once mastering those theoretical concepts, decision trees/forests is a very easy algorithm to understand, and tends to be pretty accurate across most relational data sets. It was an insight that let me know that my initial perceptions of machine learning being a field of barely understandable convoluted math is not exactly true. Instead, machine learning is about fully understanding advanced theoretical concepts and then asking yourself, and now what? With the information I have, how can I make it more advanced? How can I provide use and additional insights by taking advantage of these findings? I find this is a great ideology to take advantage of my education here at Northeastern. With every new skill I develop, it unlocks a realm of possibilities for me to be creative and to think deeply about my impact.","Since starting my journey as a Computer Science major here at Northeastern two years ago, I have had a plethora of experiences that have launched my understanding of this career to whole new heights. After the boot camp that was Object Oriented Design, I learned the value and critical importance of not procrastinating, and to never underestimate the magnitude of errors a programmer can run into. After participating in hair-ripping, stress-inducing hackathons, I learned about the importance of understanding the technologies you are using and developed methods to troubleshoot efficiently and effectively. After TAing Fundamentals of Computer Science 1, I learned how to break problems down to effectively communicate complex ideas to people who had never had a frame of reference to these kinds of issues before. After working with a large corporate software team, I have learned how critical documentation is for understanding legacy codebases, and how to ask effective questions that not only advance your understanding of your own work, but also communicates your willingness to learn about whatever a mentor can teach you. After these various opportunities I have been blessed with, I consider myself a well rounded, effective member of any team I join.","I wanted to communicate again how thrilled I was to see that Generate was starting to explore the field of data science in an opportunity for students to get involved in a team outside of classes and in a collaborative effort that I couldn't achieve on my own. I was excited particularly because after getting a taste of DS, I found myself drawn to the field and I wanted to seek out as many opportunities to explore it as possible. I know that my resume may not be stacked in data science experience, but I am eager to learn and hit the ground running, especially with the guidance and patience of my peers. I'm excited to see what's in store for this new chapter!","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=f84f647e-a154-43f7-be0d-312079ba25be","a5dabc18404c55c779b8f635610f40fd"

","One technical skill I’ve grown confident in is front-end web development, specifically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, accessible interfaces. I’ve also been developing in TypeScript and React, building out projects from concept to deployment. However, I’d love to deepen my knowledge in data visualization and data storytelling, especially using libraries like D3 or frameworks like Vega-Lite. I’m motivated to learn when I see how a new tool or skill can help create a better experience for users. That’s why I gravitate toward challenges that combine design thinking with technical implementation.","One concept that’s really influenced me is the idea of human-centered data visualization, especially as advocated by designers like Georgia Lupi. Her work emphasizes making data feel personal, emotional, and accessible, which really resonates with my background in design and HCI. It’s helped me reframe how I approach data. It's not just something to analyze, but as a story to communicate.","As an incoming fourth year, I have had the opportunity to experience two different co-ops. These experiences have helped me shape where I want to be after graduation. Coming into co-op, I wasn't sure what exactly my desires were when it came to CS/Design, but being able to apply my skills in a professional setting allowed me to figure out my goals and strengths when it comes to these fields. Extracurricular / Professional experiences are a way for me to grow as an individual as well as grow within the community.

In previous projects, I’ve gained hard skills to understand hypothetical situations like how the placement of trader joes affects surrounding real estate pricing. These projects have shown me how understanding data can drive tangible impact. Generate offers a hands-on and collaborative environment where I can directly contribute to impactful projects. I hope to move onto building solutions that address real-world challenges. I want to grow beyond just analyzing data for analysis. Generate provides a platform to evolve from data insight to data action, turning analysis into solutions that matter.  ","A technical skill I’m confident in is the Python language. Python is my go to tool. I’ve used it extensively to clean and analyze data for many of my assignments and personal projects. Python’s simple yet versatile nature as a language is really appealing to me. Python can be used to clean datasets, extract insights, create visualizations, scrape information, and even build predictive models. It’s a powerful and flexible language that I enjoy using to explore data. One thing I would like to deepen my understanding of is creating scalable data pipelines. I’ve previously used SQL for creating databases, but I want to gain more industry level skills on large data management and operations with Apache Airflow or Spark. Scalable pipelines will move me beyond static analyses and into more continuous insights to data. I am motivated to optimize data workflows and understand how to handle larger datasets efficiently. This is a skill critical for delivering durable solutions in real-client facing scenarios.","I admire Dr. Fei-Fei Li’s work in AI, especially her Democratizing AI through ImageNet and her advocacy for ethical data use. Dr. Li comes from a similar discipline, a combination of computer science and neuroscience, which resonates with my dual major in Data Science and Biology. Her interdisciplinary lens to problem solving reminds me that data isn't just about numbers, but also its nuanced implications to the many systems in our world. When working on my labor productivity analysis project, the numbers collected were real metrics from present industries and the figures I produced for the analysis reflected the biases in our current workforce. It’s important to recognize these biases in the data and our own work because these algorithms don't operate in a vacuum, they shape the many decisions in our everyday life. At Generate, I’d bring this mindset to client projects, ensuring our solutions help build meaningful progress.","I’m new to Generate, but I believe that my technical skills and collaborative experiences would allow me to fit right in. When working on my “The Trader Joe's Effect” project, I web scraped raw data and transformed them into visualizations that developed insights for future solutions. When working on NUConnect, I learned to balance users' needs with technical constraints, all while creating a real-time running database. My experiences with data manipulation, such as cleaning datasets and creating visualizations, has taught me to uncover insights quickly. Beyond technical skills, my roles as a TA and STEM mentor strengthened my ability to communicate efficiently. These experiences have also taught me to translate complex concepts for a diverse audience. This equips me with skills to easily explain data workflows to clients or troubleshooting code with teammates. I’m excited to bring this blend of technical rigor and collaborative problem-solving to Generate.

I still remember interviewing Linwood, the Software Director, and seeing his eyes light up as he described the team’s Proof of Concept Day. That conversation stuck with me. It showed me that people at Generate aren’t just here to build their resumes — they’re genuinely proud of their work, and it shows in everything from their app prototypes to their Instagram captions. Going to Showcase Day, chatting with leads, and joining Thursday content meetings gave me a real sense of how tight-knit and driven this team is. Even though there are lots of other clubs doing client work, Generate just feels different. The level of care and detail people put into their work is contagious. I also love that there's space to grow, whether that's through mentorship, Makerspace access, or just being surrounded by people who are excited to build cool stuff. It’s a place where I know I’ll be pushed to do my best, but also supported the whole way.","One technical skill I’ve developed confidence in is fine-tuning machine learning hyperparameters. I first learned about this in high school while working on a sleep apnea prediction model for the Synopsys Science Fair. There were no step-by-step instructions — just me, StackOverflow, and a lot of trial and error. Over time, I began to understand the deeper logic behind tuning, like how a lower learning rate helps prevent the model from settling in a local minimum in a larger dataset. I also learned that hyperparameters only matter up to a point. Unless you really mess them up, the dataset itself usually has a much bigger impact on performance.  One skill I’m eager to improve is statistical analysis, particularly methods like ANOVA and MANOVA. As someone interested in psychology and behavioral research, I know mastering these tools is essential to finding meaning in complex data and also helps you frame the research questions you ask. What motivates me to take on challenges is the impact I hope to make. I’m driven by the “why” behind what I learn. For example, all my past research projects related to data analysis or machine learning stemmed from my interest in the subject itself, whether that be sleep apnea, transformers (the architecture behind ChatGPT), or studying the emotion of fear.","A methodology that has deeply influenced how I think about data science is the transformer architecture, first introduced in the Attention Is All You Need paper. What struck me most about this work wasn’t just the performance improvements it brought, it was the way it challenged assumptions. By removing recurrence (the mechanism for CNNs and RNNs) and relying entirely on attention, the authors showed that it was possible to now relate words in context with each other over longer ranges — something not possible before! That mindset of questioning the default approach has directly shaped a research project I worked on involving Fourier transforms for audio processing. I was inspired by follow-up work like the FNet, which replaced attention with Fourier-based token mixing. I became curious: if transformers could succeed without recurrence, could they also work without attention? That question led me to explore alternatives in audio processing, using Fourier transforms to pick up patterns across an entire sound clip, while also making the model faster and less resource-intensive to run. That lesson continues to shape how I approach research: by staying open to unconventional ideas and exploring options outside of “industry-standard” or “state-of-the-art” approaches.","To me, Generate is a space where people are genuinely united by a shared drive to create something meaningful. Even though my role as a copywriter on the Content team was relatively small, I felt like my work mattered as I got to shape Generate’s voice. Some of my favorite memories were interviewing members and sharing their stories through written words. It made the creative process feel personal and impactful. What stood out most during my time on the team was how collaborative and supportive the culture is. During my one semester in Generate, everyone I met was so humble and professional. Most importantly, they were always willing to help. I remember struggling to write a blog post for Proof of Concept, and executive members like Jay and Chirag jumped in with thoughtful feedback that made the writing process much smoother.  Generate has also influenced the kind of work I want to do moving forward. I’ve realized how much I enjoy being in environments where I can collaborate across disciplines. I loved Thursdays where I would meet with the other members on my team, giving feedback on their graphic designs and seeing how I could create captions that went along with the visual content (short films, Instagram posts, etc).","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=ad2e9f6f-f1a1-482d-b21a-bc0d2ba80294","dfa65ca48f2dd0d1d1f2d7b6c016c988"

Looking through the posts, I thoroughly enjoyed reading through the innovative projects that people were working on. Even though this club has achieved so much already through the various number of projects and clients, they still strive to achieve a lot more and keep pushing their members to always put in their best foot. In a club like this, I will always be put in a position to do my best and that will help me grow personally and professionally and will always have the opportunity to be innovative and learn. Its value of  being innovative sets it apart from a lot of the clubs on campus and it is visible through the projects that this club has worked on. Apart from that, by being a Data Science major, there aren’t many clubs on campus that really are meant for my skillset. By now taking on clients as well on the Data side, it shows that Generate is willing to grow, develop and change to meet the demands of the world and that is something I want to be a part of. I will also finally have a club where my exact skill set can fit in and this will cause me to excel in this role. ","One technical skill that I developed is machine learning within python. Some machine learning skills that I have developed are NLP, regression, PCA, Recommendation systems, and more.  One technical skill that I would like to learn and improve on is Java. While I have very basic knowledge on Java, I would like to learn more about its applications. Even though it is not directly related to my major, learning Java would give me a different perspective on how to code which will make me a better programmer overall.  What motivates me to learn new things is actually a quote that I have read: “A jack of all trades is a master of one, but certainly better than a master of one”. Growing up I realized that people who have a curiosity towards things they don’t know will not end their learning with school and are more knowledgeable. This is why when I come across a challenge, I take it as a learning opportunity and never get discouraged. What motivates me is the mentality that either I’ll be able to solve it and learn for later, or I will fail and learn from my mistakes. Either way, I will be learning.","One of my favorite data science methodologies is machine learning, particularly its ability to analyze data and solve problems almost like a human would. In many ways, we already do this intuitively like knowing that traffic is worse during rush hour, however, machine learning takes this to a whole new level by processing far more data than any human could and producing predictions with impressive accuracy (when trained well). ML fills in the blanks for what people are wondering and that is really cool.  When it comes to how it changed my approach into my own work, I will now always look for improvement. When it comes to ML systems/programs, there can always be tweaking and training to be done to get a more accurate estimate. You can plug in more data points, change up the variables it’s using, use more sentiment analysis, use a different ML program, etc. ","My first semester in Generate was last Spring, and it turned out to be far more meaningful than I had anticipated. I thought it was going to be like any other club where you meet, work, disperse, and then meet again the following week. However, I have realized that it is a true community in itself. Specifically within the Data team, I wasn’t expecting both teams to be as close as they were. When we met once a month, it was as if we all knew each other for a long time and continued conversations as normal. Even within my own team, we did dinners and study sessions together. It has truly given me a family. This has given me a new perspective on how a club should be and also gave me more confidence to ask questions and learn skills that I previously did not know. The supportive and collaborative environment made it easy to seek help with both data science tasks but also with co-op applications and professional development. I truly couldn’t imagine a better club to be in and it truly changed my experience.

I love that it's not just about learning theory or networking but that you're actually working on real-world projects that make an impact. This kind of experience is hard to find (trust I’ve attended meetings for several clubs and not found what I was looking for, no shade lmao)  What excites me most is the chance to contribute as a data analyst or data visualizer. There aren’t many clubs where I can apply my sql skills or develop visualisations but Generate gives me that opportunity. I know I’ll get to work on real problems, collaborate with a team, and gain insight into how data shapes decisions in a product-building environment. The amount I’ll be able to learn, from technical skills to team dynamics, is something I’m genuinely looking forward to.  From what I’ve seen, people at Generate are passionate, motivated, and constantly learning. That’s the kind of community I want to be a part of. I know I’ll be challenged, supported, and inspired to grow.","One technical skill I’ve developed and feel confident in is SQL. I first learned it in my Information Visualization class and found it pretty straightforward. But when I started working at a leading CRM company in India, I realized just how complex and powerful it can be. I worked extensively with both PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server, and through building queries, optimizing performance, and handling real client data, I became fluent in SQL. That experience taught me the difference between classroom learning and real-world application (hence, generate).  A skill I’d really like to grow is machine learning and AI. While I understand data well, I don’t yet have the coding depth to apply it in building models. I’ll be taking Data Visualization and Data Modeling for Business as part of my minor next semester, and I’m excited to keep building my data science toolkit. I see Generate as another great way to do that through real, hands-on work.  As for what motivates me: honestly, I just get bored easily. I’ve always loved the stress, adrenaline, and energy that come with tech projects. There’s something about fast typing and solving hard problems that feels like my version of creating art.","One of the first data science concepts I ever learned was linear regression, in my Information Visualization class. I took this course as a freshman, and I remember feeling completely out of place as everyone around me seemed older and more experienced (to be fair, I’m  extremely short so everyone looks older) During one of the first lectures, I saw all these terms like R-squared, p-values, and residuals , none of which I understood. My professor cold-called constantly, and I was half-convinced I should drop the class and take it later when I felt more prepared. But I pushed myself to stay one more class... then another. Slowly, it all started making sense.  What I love about linear regression is how something so mathematically simple can be so powerful, taking something abstract like a pattern in data and turning it into a line you can see and use to make predictions. It was the first time I saw data tell a story.  Beyond the technical skill, the experience taught me something even more valuable: not to give up at the first sign of feeling small or unprepared. That mindset has stayed with me ever since.","This summer, I interned at Hansa Cequity as part of their Data Solutions Group, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had so far. My co-intern and I worked on a CRM analytics project for a retail client, where we focused on analyzing campaigns. We wrote a lot of SQL queries on PostgreSQL and got really comfortable with it by the end. We also built a customer database that included everything from demographics to how people engaged with campaigns, and I made Power BI dashboards to pull insights from that data.  We were working with huge datasets (almost a million rows) and learned the hard way how important it is to write efficient queries. One of the coolest parts was getting to sit in on client meetings and seeing how the work we were doing connected to real business decisions.  The team at Hansa was incredibly welcoming and supportive. They taught us a lot, not just about SQL or dashboards, but about working in a team, asking questions, and being open to learning.

From the outside, it’s clear that Generate isn’t just a place where students build impressive technical projects, it’s a space where people grow together. I’m especially drawn to how Generate blends collaboration with curiosity. The Data Science branch, in particular, offers the opportunity to apply skills in machine learning, analytics, and engineering, but what excites me most is the chance to do that while working closely with a supportive, interdisciplinary team. I value environments where people are not only motivated to do great work but also take the time to teach, learn from each other, and celebrate each other’s wins. Being part of a community like Generate, where people are passionate, intentional, and inclusive, is something I’m really looking for at Northeastern. I’m eager to contribute to that culture, build meaningful projects, and push myself outside of the classroom while working alongside others who care deeply about what they do. ","One technical skill I’ve developed and feel confident in is data wrangling with Python, particularly using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. I’ve applied this skill in both academic and project settings to clean messy datasets, handle missing values, and prepare structured inputs for modeling and visualization. Over time, it has become intuitive for me to break down raw datasets and transform them into formats that support meaningful insights. A technical area I’d like to improve is working with cloud platforms like AWS to build end-to-end data pipelines. While I’m comfortable building models and analyzing data locally, I want to bridge the gap between analysis and real-world deployment, ensuring that my work can scale, integrate with broader systems, and provide lasting value.   I’m motivated to take on challenges when I see an opportunity to learn something new and apply it in a meaningful way. I enjoy stepping outside of my comfort zone and figuring things out through hands-on experience. Even when a task is difficult, I’m driven by the progress I make and the skills I gain along the way. That, combined with the sense of accomplishment at the end, makes the effort feel truly worthwhile.","One of my favorite data science methodologies is Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA. It involves using visualizations and statistics to explore a dataset before applying any models. EDA helps uncover trends, patterns, missing values, and relationships between variables. Just as importantly, it can also show what is not present in the data, which can be a valuable insight on its own.  I appreciate EDA because it often reveals unexpected findings. In some cases, the lack of a relationship between two variables has led me to ask better questions or reconsider my assumptions. This approach encourages a deeper understanding of the data, rather than rushing to build a model too quickly.  EDA has shaped the way I approach problem-solving by helping me focus on context, clarity, and curiosity. I use tools like box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to get a full picture of the data’s structure. These insights guide how I clean the data, select features, and design my analysis.  Overall, EDA keeps me grounded in the data itself. It helps ensure that any models I build are based on a clear understanding of the problem and the information available.","My professional and extracurricular experiences have helped me become a more collaborative, thoughtful, and purpose-driven individual. I immerse myself fully in the organizations I join, striving to be an active and reliable team member. Even within the first month of my co-op at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, I’ve begun to see how technical skills like SQL and data integration support broader business goals. Working in a data governance environment has deepened my critical thinking about how data flows between systems and how to prioritize decisions impacting multiple stakeholders. I’ve also become more intentional in my communication and ask more strategic, insightful questions. One of my most rewarding extracurricular experiences has been serving as a teaching assistant for DS2000. Supporting students, especially when they feel stuck, taught me how to break down abstract concepts and communicate technical ideas clearly. It also helped me become more comfortable giving and receiving feedback, and more proactive in group settings. Both experiences have strengthened me not only technically but also interpersonally. They’ve shaped how I work in teams, approach problems, and contribute to communities, qualities I’m excited to bring to a collaborative, mission-driven organization like Generate.","Thank you for the opportunity to apply!","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=9b96df3e-9ac5-4af7-827c-7c39979d05ae","fb8193d512b8eea04605009bea331509"

Contrasting many other northeastern organizations that use data science in financial or consulting settings, I am eager to contribute to Generate's product first ideology. I am primarily excited about the Data team’s entirely client facing role this year and experience building products for a range of use cases.","Much of my statistical and machine learning foundation is based in econometrics, specifically causal inference which is primarily relevant to marketing data science. I’ve developed a strong understanding of incrementality testing which uses experimentation and quasi-experimental methods to measure the true value a marketing decision or channel provides. Causal techniques like randomized control trials, geo-based holdout experiments, or synthetic control methods isolate causal effects from confounding factors providing a clearer picture for marketing decision makers. In contrast to my statistical background, I would like to improve my coding skills, ensuring that it is production level with scalability. Without significant experience coding in a professional space, Generate provides a perfect opportunity to learn from more experienced individuals and meet client facing production standards. Throughout all of my life, I have had a natural tendency to dive deep into niche topics. As I think about my professional future, I am most drawn to marketing data science.","Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) has experienced a renaissance thanks to recent advances in causal machine learning, particularly as privacy regulations limit traditional attribution methods. Modern MMM approaches leverage causal inference techniques to address fundamental questions about media effectiveness that correlation-based models cannot answer. The core challenge in MMM is disentangling the causal impact of different marketing channels from confounding factors like seasonality, external events, and channel interactions. Traditional econometric approaches often struggled with media saturation curves and adstock effects, leading to oversimplified linear assumptions. Recent developments in causal ML have introduced more sophisticated solutions. For example, Bayesian structural time series models, popularized by Google's CausalImpact package, use synthetic control methods to estimate counterfactual scenarios. The shift toward causal ML in MMM is enabling marketers to move from ""what happened"" to ""what would happen if we changed our media strategy,"" fundamentally transforming budget allocation decisions. This shift from correlation to causation has shaped the way I approach problem solving in my own work. Rather than using the fanciest or hottest technique, I find value in uncovering root causes. ","During my first co-op at Scotiabank, I analyzed economic policies and briefed C-suite executives on my findings. This experience sparked my interest in statistical policy analysis, leading me to research causal inference techniques, specifically Difference-in-Differences methods and Synthetic Control Methods. I discovered that many econometric skills transfer directly to marketing data science, and quickly grew interested in uncovering consumer behavior. As I seek a second co-op and map out my early career, I am diving deeper into Marketing Mix Modeling, incrementality testing, and attribution analysis. To supplement my learning in school, I am currently building a Python library that simplifies applying complex statistical techniques in the marketing data science space. This has helped me tremendously, forcing me to break down complex statistical methods. In addition to my personal projects, while at Scotiabank, I was eager to dive deeper into econometric research so I reached out to NYU professors and am currently a Research Assistant there. As a Research Assistant, I am continuously learning about experimental design trade-offs. I find that every professional experience I have, evokes a new interest and opportunity.","N/A","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=03011460-85b6-44d5-8514-3ba61c5330f5","2c8397e9a560906fddcc0de4c1f26768"

I am interested in Generate as it creates the best combination of both. While I have experience in a research setting, Generate allows me to expand that to gaining industry experience through  projects, which is where I want my future career to be. Generate helps me learn how to conduct data analysis and build models not just statistically accurate, but that take into account business contexts to create genuine value, all while exposing me to new tech stacks and workflows to learn essential data science technical skills. Combining this with Generate’s community, however, is what makes it the place I will thrive. Not only will Generate give me experience of working in Data Science with a team, but it will also give me mentors and peers who will push me to become the best Data Scientist I can be. I am eager to learn in Generate’s community, become a prominent part in it, then give back and continue the cycle of developing Data Scientists. Of all the organizations on campus, Generate will develop my personal and professional skills the most.","Through my research, my internship, and classwork, I’ve gained significant experience in data cleaning and manipulation. With languages like Python and SQL and through datasets like medical claims data, medicaid, and my restaurant dataset, I’ve learned how to manipulate, merge, sort, filter, and expand datasets. Considering how data can be extremely messy and often not in one place, I am confident in using this skill to any domain for any project. The thing that truly motivates me to manipulate the data and learn, however, is the ability to take my manipulated data and learn new ways to uncover insights and predictions from it. The idea that I can transform rows of numbers and words into multiple kinds of models, each that can predict the future or uncover insights is incredibly interesting to me, and a growing passion of mine.  This is the skill I would love to improve upon, specifically in Machine Learning/Model Building. I have self taught experience building simple models. With my knowledge of Linear Algebra and my upcoming classes, I am eager to utilize that experience into becoming skilled at building industry ready machine learning models that create concrete business value and decisions.","While learning Data science, the most influential advice and framework I have learned is to think of Data Science as a story, and presentations in the framework of storytelling. Although it took me a while to understand what this meant, Data Storytelling helps me navigate Data Science.  For one, it helps even from the beginning of the process. Storytelling has encouraged me to ask questions, inquire about questions that could lead to a story. It has shaped my approach to look for questions that can be answered through data, especially questions that can be explored.  From there, Data Storytelling has impacted most on what problems to solve and how to communicate and think about them. One key aspect of being a Data Scientist is communicating what you’ve done to others not as familiar with the data. Storytelling has provided me with the framework to evaluate what problems are worth solving, what kind of result you’re looking for(a yes/no question or an open ended question), and how to solve the problem. Overall, Storytelling has changed how I view data science by humanizing data in a way where it feels clear on how to navigate creating actionable insights.","My experiences, professional and extracurricular, have instilled in me a mathematical basis of thinking, something that I apply consistently to my life. With math, especially statistics, it has been so interesting to me that numbers can connect to real life in such a concrete way. Whether it be through high school clubs, or developing and expanding ideas, mathematical thinking has shaped my life and I’ve always known that my future career would utilize this thinking. The summer before college, I discovered my passion for programming through completing CS50p. There was such an exciting feeling of writing lines of code, each connecting together to logically execute an algorithm with a built purpose. I still continuously chase this feeling to this day. However, learning SQL made me realize my passion lies at the intersection of Statistics and Programming: Data Science. Writing code to mold any dataset, leading to Machine Learning, is an enthralling process. Learning how mathematical concepts intertwine with coding in a way to predict outcomes, uncover sights, or so many other possibilities, I knew that my future would lie in Data Science. I anticipate using this thinking through Generate, fostering my passion for Data Science amongst my peers.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=63bf19f4-551d-4c16-b331-7b1229f0cb3e","7ec090fdc11e3e4059d5c5f2830f4d9c"

Unlike other campus organizations, Generate brings together students from not just different majors but different colleges to build full solutions, not just fragments. This past spring, I started working with Prometheus as a tech volunteer, helping clients define and implement improvements to their nonprofits. While I gained valuable experience, many of the projects were small-scale or lacked tangible final product. Generate’s model, where design, engineering, strategy, and more collaborate to deliver complete, impactful solutions, is exactly the kind of environment I am seeking. I want to contribute to real outcomes, learn from peers across disciplines, and expand both my technical and interpersonal skill set along the way.","A technical skill I have developed is my work with R, over the summer I focused primarily on this software and learned lot about data organization and visualization. I have been able to apply these skills in more than one course already and it has been something I really enjoy. For me, a technical skill I would like to grow stronger in is how I see and understand database structures along with feeling more confident in my work. What motivates me most is the idea that building technical depth allows me to better contribute to something bigger than myself, whether that’s a client solution, a team project, or a cause I care about. ","One of the most influential figures I have come across in my data science education is Hadley Wickham, the creator of tidyverse and co-author of R for Data Science. His work has brought me lots of inspiration on how I should be approaching data analysis, by emphasizing clarity, consistency, and reproducibility. Before discover Wickham’s work, I often found data science in general extremely overwhelming. Wickham’s book demystified complex concepts that I ignored previously, just by walking through real-world workflows that are common in day-to-day life. This really helped me develop a mindset that data analysis is an iterative, thoughtful processes rather than a bunch of disconnected steps as I had thought before.","My experience with Prometheus, a nonprofit that provides technology and data services, has been a major influence on my interest in Generate. I’ve worked one-on-one with clients to understand their technical needs and help implement practical solutions, which taught me to listen, adapt, and think critically. However, much of that work was solitary, and I found myself wishing for collaboration. I want the chance to bounce ideas off teammates, discuss design or data approaches, and learn from the way others solve problems. Generate offers the collaborative, cross-functional environment I have been looking for. I am excited by the idea of working closely with peers who bring different strengths and perspectives, to create meaningful, real world solutions.","n/a","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=cbfaade1-f96d-42ed-b694-038f0a7bf839","683d61326e9c67d63bcc6d90e6abb7ae"

It’s a community that values growth, curiosity, and meaningful collaboration — not just within teams but with clients as well. I especially admire Generate’s structure, with its diverse branches and strong lateral communication, which reflects the dynamics of a real company and offers an ideal environment to build both hard and soft skills. What excites me most is how deeply members care about the work and each other. The passion, commitment, and genuine support I’ve seen from Generate members is something I want to be part of and contribute to. My values strongly align with those of Generate, and I believe that my reliability, creativity, passion for problem-solving, and growth-oriented mindset would allow me to make a meaningful impact. Just as Generate can help me grow personally and professionally, I hope to be part of its continued success and positive culture.","I’m confident in my SQL skills, particularly in MySQL and DuckDB. SQL has been the primary tool I’ve used in my current internship, where I’ve implemented optimizations for fast, scalable data access and used performance analytics to assess query speed and reliability. I’ve learned by writing queries, debugging issues, and analyzing others’ code to understand different approaches. One technical skill I’d like to improve is my understanding and application of machine learning algorithms. I want to deepen my knowledge of model structures, use cases, and implementation to better apply them in real-world scenarios. I believe this is essential for making impactful contributions as a data scientist. What motivates me most is creative problem-solving. In STEM, we’re often faced with questions that don’t have clear answers. Solving them requires curiosity, persistence, and innovation. I’m especially driven by challenges because they force me to slow down, think critically, and explore new strategies. Some of my greatest growth has come from working through difficult problems as they push me to learn more than simple tasks ever could. That mindset keeps me motivated to take on new challenges and continuously improve.","My favorite data scientist is Tamar Shapiro. I had the opportunity to shadow her through an organization called Shadow Your Future, and her leadership and mentorship have strongly shaped my career goals. As the former Head of Analytics at Instagram, where she led over 350 data scientists and engineers, Tamar is a trailblazer in the field and a role model for women in data science. Shadowing her taught me that growth in this field isn’t linear; it’s a continual process of curiosity and resilience, especially when faced with ambiguous or unfamiliar challenges. I learned that there’s rarely one “right” solution; rather, being open to diverse perspectives and creative approaches is essential for solving complex problems. Tamar’s humility and commitment to empowering others, even at the highest levels, showed me the importance of supporting and uplifting new voices in the field. That lesson has stayed with me, and I hope to mentor, inspire, and empower others as I grow in my own journey.","I haven’t been in Generate, but I admire its mission deeply. As Chief Innovation Officer of MakerSafe – a nonprofit educating children about ethical AI and closing the gender gap in STEM – I developed skills in adaptability, communication, and creative problem-solving. My team and I designed engaging ways to teach complex topics like AI and programming to young children, and their enthusiasm, participation, and solid understanding of these foreign concepts was a testament to our team’s ability to present difficult content in fun, educational, and interactive ways. As a tutor for a special-needs student, I further honed my empathy and flexibility, tailoring my teaching to their unique learning style. Currently, I’m a data science intern, where I’ve learned to persevere through unfamiliar challenges, ask for help when needed, and communicate technical work clearly to diverse audiences. I’ve also learned that when a task feels overwhelming or unclear, it’s an opportunity for growth—not a reason to feel discouraged.

As someone with strong creative, communication, and problem-solving skills, what caught my attention most about Generate was their dedication to tackling real-world problems with innovation and data-driven approaches. After initially hearing about Generate in passing with friends and classmates, to ultimately deep-diving into their social media, value statements, and priorities, what stands out most to me about Generate members is their sheer ability to live in the present and think in the future. Generate is focused on creating something truly purposeful that is not only helpful from a client perspective, but reinforces the confidence, community, and skills of its members. I believe that students of all kinds benefit from the opportunity that Generate gives in allowing their members to strengthen their technical skills through actionable, meaningful projects and let their innovation and creative drive excel in a team setting. I consider Generate to be a pivotal and necessary step in both my personal and professional spheres, because of the opportunity to grow my technical and creative skills beyond what I think capable.","Data visualization is a technical skill that I have spent time developing and am ultimately confident in. Telling stories in ways that motivate the listener or viewer to be engaged is something I have consistently been dedicated to. From my hobbies of drawing, painting, and writing to telling stories to friends, my goal has always been to leave whatever audience with a message. Bringing this viewpoint into studying data science, portraying data in a meaningful way, while maintaining the notion that visualizations should be easy to understand, has become the skill I take the most pride in. A skill that I would like to improve upon is data wrangling. Becoming more comfortable with webscraping, APIs, and cleaning the data from these sources is imperative to my mission to use data to make analytical, ethical, and decisive changes in the fields I am most passionate about. My long-term goals such as this one is my key motivator for continuous growth and taking on new, intimidating challenges. I am a hard-worker who always makes efforts to understand new things and overcome challenges because I remind myself that it will all be worth it once I achieve the goal at hand.","A favorite data science algorithm of mine is K-Means Clustering. Being that this algorithm is unsupervised, it is more often than not used in recommendation systems that contain a numerical evaluation based on qualitative traits. Upon initially learning K-Means Clustering during lecture, to actually implementing a functioning model in our group project on Dialogue, I was excited to learn that both qualitative and quantitative types of data can not just coexist, but even enhance each other. Coming from a background that values humanities and descriptive nuances, it was eye-opening to see how these traits can be preserved and represented in a meaningful way within algorithmic systems. Making this realization shaped my approach in data science, to strive to ensure that numeric models, such as the K-Means Clustering using cosine similarity, do not lose the human stories behind the data. K-Means and the idea of unsupervised models as a whole taught me that ethical, story-conscious clustering is not only possible, but an entire curiosity to explore what the collaboration between the humanities and technical fields has to offer, and I hope to bring this line of thought and ethical integrity into any project within Generate.","Although I have not been in Generate before, I can definitively say that my extracurricular and professional experiences have helped shape who I am today. From mock trial and tennis in high school to exploring and creating a group project in Belgium on a Dialogue of Civilizations, my ability to work with a team and enhancement of my communication skills was tested far beyond what I thought imaginable. Within these team settings, I had the opportunity to capitalize on my skills of being spirited, positive, and collaborative, while also learning along the way to be growth-oriented and find ways to better myself through the talented people around me. Being a member of a team is more than just an individual contribution, it is a test of compromises, trust, and taking something new away from each meeting, struggle, and win. From a professional standpoint, particularly in networking within key European Union institutions on Dialogue, I have taken my traits of being communicable and personable to a new level. I have learned that professional opportunities can await anywhere, and not only is it essential to represent a broader set of values on the surface, but maintain personal ones as well.","With other parts of the application having addressed my personal values, mission, and motivation on a broader scale, I'd like to briefly highlight my commitment to bringing passion and positivity to team settings. I believe that being inclusive, a thoughtful listener, and kind are equally as important to the team as technical skills, if not more so when it comes to fostering a space where each member feels valued and heard. My experiences in high school mock trial and within a full-stack application project on Dialogue showed me how acts of kindness and encouragement can deeply affect team synergy and performance. I am excited by the opportunity to contribute compassion and innovation to the Generate team.","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=a61978e7-b438-413a-9d7d-0c6d4e159451","4414d0dd7fb030af6586ff117aae71fa"

From automated analysis of LLMs to next-generation CV models for drones: these opportunities have helped me develop skills which have dramatically shaped my academic and professional career.  A question I am left with however, is “So what?”. Often, the work you do feels like it is cast out into the void, moving onto the next task. Who ultimately benefits from the work I created, and how are they using it? What feedback do they have based on their personal needs? How can this be used to refine and iterate on my work? In a word, Generate provides “impact”. The idea that the work I'm doing isn’t just added to an ever growing number of commits or entries in conference proceedings, but is instead being applied to real problems and organizations which are seeking to solve them. Contributing to a project like SmartyPill, which can revolutionize how someone manages their health, drives a level of analysis  and user empathy that toy feedback from a QA team could never provide","A technical skill which I feel confident in is data-focused problem solving: characterizing a problem, & leveraging models and algorithms to derive actionable insights. Through my coursework at Northeastern, I've had the opportunity to approach the Data Science and ML field from numerous angles and methodologies, from traditional regression to natural language processing to agentic AI. I have applied this skill to complex real world problems, such as designing autonomous fault mitigation systems for satellites.  A skill which I would like to learn is developing production ML and Data Analysis systems. It’s one thing to be able to provide a solution to a hard problem in the lab, but another to make this accessible to people at scale. Improving on this skill has led me on an interdisciplinary path of learning to combine algorithmic knowledge with cloud computing and architecture. Thus, my primary drive to push myself is tangibility: the idea that by pursuing a new challenge or topic, I'll be able to leverage what I learn to make a meaningful difference. Being able to contextualize new learnings with this goal drives me to better consider the insights I can leverage. ","A particular framework which has changed my approach to problem solving is network analysis: representing data as a graph of interconnected nodes.  When approaching a data-driven problem, it’s often easy to oversimplify and fail to capture the nuance in the process. When applying techniques such as regression that you’ve used day in and day out, it’s easy not to question the routine assumptions of independence and randomness.  Network analysis forces you to drop these comfortable assumptions. Rather than looking at data points individually, the entire set becomes a single, dynamic & interconnected web. An individual is no longer just a row of metadata, but instead a product of its neighbors which can be extracted using algorithms such as community detection. Outliers identified through clustering analysis become crucial bottlenecks and hub-points which challenge the robustness of your techniques. This became clear working on a project analyzing GitHub contributor data. After hours spent with traditional neural networks and bayesian models, a single network plot divulged the underlying relationships driving collaboration behavior between users.  As a whole, the mindset change required by this paradigm has led me to approach my problem-solving through a more holistic lens. I leave my pre-conceived notions at the door, and consider new challenges as opportunities for exploration. I believe that this will enable me to mesh well with the interdisciplinary focus of Generate, which uses elements of software engineering, data science, hardware design, and marketing to ensure the most effective outcomes for its clients.","My professional and extracurricular experiences have equipped me to tackle problem-solving with agility and rigor. As the Flight Software Lead for the satellite development program at Northeastern, I was faced with the task of developing image compression algorithms for our satellite. The constrained hardware environment, combined with countless risks of the space environment, would have ordinarily led development to slow to a standstill. Using these constraints as signposts, I dissected the problem to identify opportunities for improvement. Rather than implementing arduous hardware testing, implementing simulated packet losses helped establish points of failure and shortlist viable models. These considerations resulted in a more effective outcome at a significantly faster pace.   As a co-op at MORSE, I was tasked with improving a data pipeline responsible for millions of data points per minute. Uncovering a bottleneck which greatly increased processing times, I had the solution of separating the pipeline into separate jobs. While unorthodox, this proved to solve the issue while greatly improving maintainability and the ease of future development.  These outcomes have taught me that efficiency isn’t just about following a standard procedure. It’s about taking existing assumptions and processes, and turning them upside down. I believe that Generate, with its focus on impactful innovation, understands this concept better than anyone.

I’m willing to challenge myself, take initiative, and improve both my data science skills and my ability to thrive in a collaborative, high performing environment.","One technical skill I am confident in is creating data visualizations using Python, specifically with Matplotlib and Seaborn. By creating charts and graphs of multiple varieties, I’ve developed the ability to tell compelling stories with data, learning to make information accessible to different audiences. An area I aim to improve upon is the application of machine learning techniques within Python. I have some experience with scikit-learn, having used it for basic classification and regression in a class final project. However, I would love to further deepen my understanding of creating and implementing machine learning solutions that truly drive impact. What motivates me to learn new things and take on challenges is a combination of curiosity and desire to solve real world problems. I’m excited to keep building my skills in both machine learning and data visualization as I work toward a career in data-driven optimization. I want to be able to transform complex data into actionable insights to make things more efficient and effective. Since data science can be used in many different industries, I’m also motivated by the opportunity to explore various fields and make a decision about my specific goals for the future.","One of my favorite data science tools and methodologies is GeoPandas, a Python library that utilizes data science for spatial visualization. While it’s not an algorithm in the traditional sense, GeoPandas acts as a powerful framework for working with geographic data, allowing me to explore a whole new sector of data analysis and compelling visualizations. I first used GeoPandas in an assignment to classify and visualize temperature data across the United States. Watching the visualization come together was exciting and rewarding. The experience helped me understand how incorporating geographic context can reveal additional hidden patterns and insights in a conventional analysis. Moving forward from that assignment, the use of GeoPandas inspired the work of my final project in the class, which analyzed traffic patterns in New York along with external factors which could affect these patterns. GeoPandas as a tool shaped my problem solving approach by encouraging me to think beyond tabular data. In the future, I would love to work on a project analyzing how location influences different trends and behaviors and how that would apply to marketing.  I’ve broadened how I formulate questions, helping me find deeper insights through combining traditional and spatial data methods.","Although I have not been a member of Generate before, my extracurricular experiences have significantly shaped my approach to collaboration, leadership, and adaptability. As a lifelong dancer, I have developed discipline and creativity, learning to balance a structured routine with excitement. I’ve expanded my skillset by learning and practicing new dance styles, which has taught me to embrace new challenges and continuously push myself. My experience as a tutor and student-teacher has strengthened my communication and leadership abilities, both across younger age groups and with my peers. These roles have taught me the importance of patience, flexibility, and clear communication, skills which are essential for successful teamwork and collaboration.  Additionally, I have stepped into the role of a Production Director for my dance team, NU Rangila. I have not yet held this position throughout a season, yet have been actively planning and organizing over the summer,  taking advice from previous production directors. I take pride in staying on task even when things aren’t urgent, preferring to be well prepared ahead of time. Overall, as someone with strong organization skills and a collaborative mindset, I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to Generate’s projects and grow both technically and professionally.","This summer, I’ve been practicing my JavaScript skills by manipulating and presenting small data sets.

Many clubs focus on specifically giving experience to computer science or business majors only, but this club collectively tries to bring data scientists, engineers, software developers, finance/business majors, and managers together to collaborate. People can thrive the strongest in these environments because they’re always challenged by differing perspectives and ultimately the end product that has tangible impact. Additionally, the description for the Data Scientist role stood out, specifically how it focuses on “implementing data solutions, building dashboards, machine learning, and pipelines that tell stories and drive impact.” That specific part of the description felt like it was describing the exact skills I used in my latest project – a cricket analytics project where I designed a hybrid prediction model using custom weighting and XGBoost, backtested it over multiple decades of data with high accuracy, and visualized these predicted projections by creating interactive and user-friendly dashboards. I also created a backend API to help dynamically filter the front end of the dashboard, making the interface more convenient for users. This taught me how to bring together modeling, backend logic, and storytelling into one user-friendly tool, which is something I know aligns with Generate’s goals. That’s why the Data Scientist role at Generate is a natural fit for my technical background. It would be extremely cool if my drive to produce user-friendly data products and love for turning raw data into something significant would help contribute to a cross functional team like Generate.","One technical skill that I’ve developed and am extremely confident in is my fluency in pandas and my manipulation in dataframes. My fluency in SQL helps with this because I’m able to tie the two skills together to query and transform the data effectively. I genuinely love data handling and processing in general because the process of seeing raw data getting shaped into something meaningful and purposeful for a project is extremely rewarding. A technical skill I want to improve upon is web development because down the line I want to create my own public website to show personal projects and get more exposure to full stack development. I think learning more about front end technologies in general will help me become a more well-rounded contributor in cross functional teams. What motivates me to learn new things is the application of the concept for the project I’m doing. Generally, when I’m invested in a project, I gather as much technical information as possible to make the end product extremely complete. To me, it doesn’t matter if a concept is foreign at first, it matters how applicable it is to my project/task, making me motivated to consistently learn and grow quickly. That’s why I seek out opportunities where I’m pushed to improve and why I’m excited by roles like Generate where learning and collaboration are the core of every product. ","While there’s many more advanced ones, my favorite data science methodology is exploratory data analysis because it’s the first moment of the project where a data analyst gets to truly interact with the data. This step is very crucial because it sets the foundation for multiple important decisions and observations to follow such as the feasibility of the data (whether you have missing data and multiple outliers), which variables interact well with one another, and how to take the project forward given the behavior of each variable. Understanding these steps will elevate your analytical skills and will let you have full control over which future steps seem correct. In my own work, especially the recent cricket analytics project, I followed those steps, and it played a massive role in the success of it. At first, my goal of the project was to just create a dashboard for the top 15 batters in cricket history. However, after graphing some basic time series plots and slicing the data up by format, country, and career stage, I realized there was a massive pattern across all batters: they generally share a semi parabolic curve trend in their batting average over a span of their career. This insight excited me, and motivated me to create a prediction algorithm to predict the number of runs a batter will score in 5 years, using this form curve as a key weightage. Without a deep EDA analysis on my end, I never would’ve been able to interact with the data that deeply and never had the vision to take the project as far as I did. It has taught me to slow down and ask thoughtful questions before jumping into technical solutions immediately. It’s shown me that good data science doesn’t immediately start with advanced algorithms, it starts with exploration and key observations. ","My extracurricular experiences from high school have shaped me to be the man I am today, especially varsity swimming. Through swimming, I learnt the hard way by having a poor start to my senior year season, where I wasn’t putting in enough effort in the beginning and our team was slowly going down the New Jersey high school swim rankings. However, as captain and a key swimmer, I realized the importance of the role, and swam my heart out every practice since, led the team with conviction, and helped us place second in counties, where I clocked my best 100 butterfly time. This wouldn’t have been possible without our collective efforts and I’m so glad that I was able to have a positive impact on my team. That experience taught me how there will be many ups and downs throughout your journey as an athlete or human, but the most improved ones are the ones who consistently show up to practice and have the resolve to keep pushing themselves no matter the situation. It’s okay to have a below average swim meet, it’s a part of life, but it’s not okay to not learn from those and stay stagnant. We must keep improving ourselves everyday to become the best versions of ourselves. That mindset shapes me to stay dedicated, accountable, and consistent in whatever activity I pursue, helping create a positive impact on the whatever team I’m in.

Being able to apply skills and concepts I have learned is very appealing. In my previous experiences doing research in academic labs, I did not have the opportunity to apply any of our findings or concepts; everything was just pure theory, and I disliked that. Generate is a place where theory can be put into practice and used for a positive cause. I'm especially interested in the data team because it is the only place on campus where I can apply both my passion for machine learning and my experience in visualization. As someone who is constantly seeking to learn more and apply what I know, I can confidently say that Generate is the place for it. Additionally, I enjoy meeting new people and I believe Generate is an organization with a collection of some of the coolest people. I would love to be a part of the Generate community.","Since discovering machine learning, I felt a certain affinity towards it, whether it be conceptually understanding different models or using them in programs. I always strive to learn more and get better at it, but I am quite confident in my technical skills when it comes to machine learning. A skill that I want to learn and improve upon, however, is deploying and applying concepts. As someone who only knows Python, it is hard to create apps or websites, so I recently started learning HTML and CSS for frontend development. In terms of technical skills, I would like to improve upon frontend development as a whole. Generally speaking, anything that I am bad at is quite motivating. I am competitive by nature and love challenges. Usually, if there is something that I struggle with or fail at, it becomes great motivation for me to learn more and take on new challenges. I will keep tackling a topic until I feel confident and comfortable with it, continuously learning and pushing myself further.","My favourite data science influential figure is Andrew Ng. If you do not know who he is, Andrew Ng is the founder of Coursera and DeepLearning.AI. Both of these are open-source platforms where anyone can learn about data science without any prerequisites or applications. Andrew Ng is the first person to help me effectively learn ML and AI in a simple way. He is able to break down complicated concepts into shorter, easily digestible sections. What I like about Andrew Ng isn't his technical expertise, as there are many out there with the same skillset. I like his ability to teach and his focus on implementation over pure theory. His advice to ""start with a simple model and iterate"" has become central to my problem-solving approach. This philosophy from Andrew Ng has shaped how I tackle projects. For example, instead of immediately jumping to complex neural networks for my ML projects, I now begin with simpler models to establish baselines and truly understand the data. In a recent project predicting Taylor Swift song popularity, I started with linear regression before moving to more sophisticated methods. Starting this simple-to-complicated approach for my projects has helped me understand the data better and speed up the development process.","N/A","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=a3d163ed-5253-44a6-babf-d6d4877e03c2","5248a1317932eca527e44ce33374c921"

Data fascinates me because it allows me to uncover meaningful insights that can drive real change. I love how data turns complex problems into understandable stories and helps make better decisions. Generate’s hands-on, project-based approach lets me apply my skills in a collaborative setting where feedback and iteration are prioritized, which mirrors how real data science happens in the workplace. During my internship at Kloze AI, I experienced firsthand how teamwork and communication improve problem-solving, especially when debugging automated tests and preparing backend data. I appreciate how Generate emphasizes growth not just technically, but also in teamwork and communication, which I believe are essential for making an impact. Being part of a community that is intentional, inclusive, and driven aligns closely with my goals.","One technical skill I am confident in is data cleaning and preprocessing. During my projects and internship I worked extensively with raw datasets by retrieving, cleaning, and preparing data so it could be used for analysis or modeling. For example, at Kloze AI I cleaned and formatted data from a MySQL database to ensure our automated tests ran correctly and produced valid results. This experience taught me the importance of handling missing values, formatting data correctly, and ensuring accuracy before drawing insights.  A skill I want to improve is building scalable data pipelines. While I have experience working with data in smaller projects I am eager to learn how to design efficient pipelines that can handle larger datasets and automate data workflows. Improving this skill will help me contribute to more complex real world data solutions.  What motivates me to learn new things and take on challenges is the impact data can have when handled well. I enjoy uncovering hidden patterns and using data to solve problems, offering a new perspective that can drive meaningful change.","One data science methodology I really value is data visualization. I believe that visualizing data is key to understanding complex patterns and communicating findings clearly. Proper data visualization turns complex data into clear and compelling stories. By using the right charts and visuals, it helps highlight trends, patterns, and relationships that might be hidden in rows of numbers.  In many of my projects, I’ve used tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create charts and graphs that reveal trends, correlations, and outliers that might be missed in raw numbers alone. For example, during my analysis of public school data, I developed multi dimensional visualizations that showed how teacher experience and student demographics affected academic performance. These visuals not only helped me draw clearer conclusions but also made it easier to share my findings with others, including those without a technical background. This approach has shaped the way I work by always reminding me to think beyond just numbers and code. I focus on how to present data clearly so that insights are understandable and actionable for a wide audience. When I solve problems, I make sure to explore different ways of visualizing data to uncover hidden patterns or unexpected trends. It also helps me communicate more effectively with teammates and clients who may not have a technical background. Ultimately, it encourages me to be both analytical and creative in how I approach data challenges.","When I started my internship at Kloze AI, I was thrown into a fast paced environment where I quickly learned that real world coding is not just about writing perfect programs it is about problem solving and collaboration. I remember one moment debugging an automated test that kept failing because the data from the MySQL database was not formatted right. After digging into the data cleaning it and asking for advice from teammates we finally got the tests running smoothly. That experience showed me the value of persistence and teamwork.  In another project analyzing public school data I uncovered patterns showing achievement gaps that challenged my assumptions and made me realize how powerful data can be to tell stories that matter. Volunteering in Greece teaching English to first graders was a different kind of challenge that taught me patience and the importance of supporting others as they learn.  These moments have shaped how I approach problems with curiosity teamwork and a focus on impact. That is why I am excited about Generate where I can keep learning through collaboration and real projects that make a difference.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=168cc662-27ba-40ed-a0e5-933bdb713cd5","673d730f4dbb75aa6786d78420a1fc1c"

Its focus on building real products for clients all in the semester’s time frame where it’s all a sprint from ideation to product is demanding. That type of intensive, foundation-building is what Generate is all about and I want to contribute to that as part of the Data branch. I want to help redefine how data can be used creatively within a client-centric environment while learning from like-minded and experienced peers in all walks of academia.   My pivot from CS fundamentals into a growing experience with data problems draws me to the Data branch specifically. At my current co-op, I’m exploring financial, enrollment, and administrative, experimenting with predictive modelling in revenue projections, data, building visualizations and dashboards for reports. Generate would be the ideal, brand new context where I can apply these skills. Ultimately, I’m excited to be a part of this new branch and bring my analytical mindset to iterative problem-solving. Generate represents some of the best challenges undertaken by students in these organizations, and it is a community I’d be proud to grow with. ","One technical strength I’m confident is in algorithmic thinking, especially when applied to data problems. I enjoy reducing large, complex datasets into meaningful vectorized pipelines, efficient SQL queries or logical design for data transformation. I like being able to map a solution from idea to actual implementation.   What I want to get better at is applying that logic to messier, real-world data problems. I’ve mostly worked with structured, curated datasets or academic datasets. I would definitely like more experience with noisy or incomplete data, build robust pipelines that are adaptable to change, and make considerations on deployment and scalability. I am concerned about my lack of exposure to interesting or real-world data that doesn’t necessarily make sense at first. It’s something I’m getting to learn at my co-op, and am hoping to learn more with time!   I’m motivated by the desire to extract clarity out of chaos. I find joy in deriving structure from murky problems and using my curiosity as a tool to see the bigger picture. I enjoy the challenge of seeing how effective the data can be in filling in the gaps and completing the story. ","My favourite algorithm is the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the stable-matching problem, a fundamental concept in graph theory and economics. It provides a clean, simple procedure to match two groups based on submitted preferences, guaranteeing stable and optimal matching on one group’s perspective. It encourages me to seek clarity and reiterates to me that “complex problems often have simple solutions that are overlooked.” It’s quite elegant logic paired with powerful real-world applications, like assigning medical students to residencies or matching students in a club to teams/projects based on their interests : )  Leo Breiman left academia to pursue poetry and he returned, only to revolutionize machine learning through predictive models (he invented Random Forests!). I admire his courage to challenge traditional beliefs in statistics and his focus on practical results over theoretical hypotheticals. His work really pushes me to embrace complexity and not be afraid to take the most bizarre, unconventional route to arrive at a solution worth getting to. He also says to embrace the complexity and messiness of data.   I suppose I just really appreciate the dichotomy of data. That balance between simplicity and complexity, that’s what makes it interesting, intellectually rigorous, but at the same time, deeply human. ","In my two years at Northeastern, my experiences have spanned research, teaching and internships, and span several domains. I’ve studied algorithms and logic through intensive coursework and self-exploration. I’ve been researching AI/ML since high school, and at college, I’ve even had the chance to build a full-scale RL model that worked on real-life financial data and performed dynamic hedging for options trading. I am currently working in data analytics for my co-op, and I have been involved in a few full-stack projects, mostly with backend and database integration work.   All these experiences are tied together by data. Collecting, cleaning, analyzing and employing data to drive predictions or products. I’ve found that it’s not just building tools, but designing intelligent systems that drives me. That realization has really helped me hone in on data engineering and applied machine learning. I am quite excited to explore interesting ML designs like recommendation and filtering systems. I love the mix of creativity and technical depth that takes raw data into useful drivers of change. It’s what excites me about Generate! I want to interact and learn from people who have insights into thoughtful design and meaningful impact.

Frankly, there aren’t many organizations that cater to Data Science students and allow them to expand their technical and/or professional skills, which is why I was very excited about Generate’s expansion to include a new Data branch. As I explore my personal and professional goals, I’ve started to develop an interest in the product side of research and data and I’m hoping to apply for similar co-op roles in the fall. I admire Generate’s mission of growth through personal experience; I believe this role would prepare me well for co-op. I also think the products it produces are really unique and interesting (as a crafter, I love the candle maker). For those reasons, I would like to join Generate to hone my data science skills and explore the product side of data, breaking beyond my initial comfort zone of academic research.","I’m very confident with my skills in experimental design. Having designed and executed numerous research studies for psychology, including a PEAK Award-funded independent research project, I’ve gained significant hands-on experience in the process from start to finish. My experience in and out of the classroom, especially working as a research assistant in a neuroscience lab, has guided my skills in planning and executing studies. As I mentioned in my previous answer, I’d like to expand my skillset in data analysis beyond academia, specifically in using my skills in analysis to apply to the product side. Academia is personally interesting to me, but my most exciting moments in research have always been when I’m able to see tangible results. For my personal career growth, that was when I got the funding to develop an independent research study and present it at several expos. I want to work with Generate to get more product experience and learn more about how I can provide data solutions that are tangible and have real, impactful results. I’m also hoping Generate’s team-based environment will inspire and teach me new things through collaboration with other data scientists and teams.    ","K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was one of the first algorithms I learned in DS2001, and it marked the beginning of my interest in the field. I was frustrated with the lack of technicality in my Psychology classes, so I decided on a whim to take DS2000, thinking that it would help supplement my research skills. In actuality, it began my love for data science, and I actually began to enjoy my DS classwork more than my psychology classwork. KNN was my first experience building a model that could make predictions based on real data, and seeing it work, even in a simple binary classification, was exciting. It taught me that even the most basic tools can be powerful when applied thoughtfully, and also that most of the work in data science comes from preprocessing, not building the actual model. That idea has stuck with me as I’ve taken on new challenges in data science: the actual solutions are relatively simple, but it’s important to be detail-oriented and careful in the preparation stages.","My first year at Northeastern was largely shaped by my two main out-of-class commitments: working in a research lab, and Chinese Student Association. A lot of my professional and academic growth developed from my hands-on experience in psychology research. Most of my social life, however, came from CSA and PAAC (Pan-Asian American Council) at Northeastern. Within PAAC, I found so many people who were similar to me, both socially and academically. We loved to do the same things, like get food together, and many of us also had similar work ethics and ambitions. After serving on the eboard last year and this upcoming year, I’ve learned a lot about how to connect with people, how to bridge communities (especially strengthening eboard-to-general-member connections), and the importance of communication and proactivity in organizations.","Looking forward to hearing from you! :)","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=8b77c029-0073-43a8-bea9-b0bc745cb6cd","0a03b0087a681a98bf85990e98a513e7"

Besides his groundbreaking contributions to deep learning, I admire his decision to use his platform to warn the world about the ethical and societal risks of AI, such as its potential role in misinformation, cybercrime, and autonomous weaponry.  Hinton’s perspective really shaped how I approach data science and product development. His warnings influenced my belief that innovation should be guided by thoughtful intention and social responsibility. This recently inspired a research project of mine and a friend’s, where I looked into whether AI can construct sound theories or detect misinformation when provided with both relevant and irrelevant data. Through it, I explored how machine learning does in solving complex problems, while also confronting its limitations around morality, bias, and human emotion.

The studio model provides the opportunity to work on impactful, production-level projects alongside cross-functional teams—an environment that fosters and encourages growth and creativity. Just as important, I value the chance to surround myself with driven, like-minded individuals who are passionate about building and learning together. ","One skill I’ve grown confident in is designing systems that are clean, reliable, and easy to work with—whether that means organizing information, structuring workflows, or building for long-term usability. Lately, I’ve been interested in learning how to take those foundations further, connecting them to real outcomes through smoother, end-to-end implementation. What drives me is the process of refining ideas into something tangible and useful—especially when it involves navigating uncertainty, collaborating across perspectives, and building things that make a difference.","To be honest, I don’t have a favorite methodology yet—I’m still early in my journey and exploring different techniques through projects and tutorials. One that stood out recently was a YouTube tutorial I followed on predicting Premier League match outcomes. It introduced me to basic classification models and how small feature changes could affect predictions. While I didn’t fully understand every concept at the time, the experience taught me how iterative and experiment-driven this kind of work is. It pushed me to be more curious, pay attention to data quality, and focus on asking the right questions—things I now try carry into every project I take on.","Although I have not been a part of Generate, my professional and extracurricular experiences have been extremely formative. Working as a Data Engineering Intern and an IT Co-op exposed me to real-world system design, cross-functional collaboration, and production-level tooling.

Working on cross-functional teams that ship models, dashboards, and software to actual startups means every sprint produces tangible impact and fast feedback, which matches how I learn best. The studio’s mix of engineers, designers, and data scientists mirrors the professional settings I want to enter, so I can sharpen my math-driven analysis while learning to communicate insights to non-technical teammates. Plus, the close-knit community and built-in peer mentorship mean I can sharpen my technical skills and user-focused problem solving alongside peers who actively share what they learn.","I am most confident in exploratory data analysis with Python, where I clean messy datasets, pull patterns with pandas and NumPy, and back findings with solid statistical checks. The skill I want to strengthen next is building scalable data pipelines on cloud platforms such as AWS so that insights flow automatically and handle real-time streams. Whenever a plot or proof reveals an unexpected pattern I feel a spark that pushes me to dive deeper, learn the missing tool, and take on the next challenge.","Leo Breiman’s work on random forests shapes how I approach predictive modeling. I like the way the ensemble handles complex interactions and guards against overfitting through bootstrapped sampling and out of bag error checks. When I built a volunteer no show predictor for a food pantry, a random forest baseline captured nonlinear relationships that logistic regression overlooked and raised recall from sixty to eighty percent. The project taught me to favor flexible models with built in validation and to keep my pipeline honest with rigorous out of sample testing.","Although I haven’t joined Generate yet, an experience in my California hometown shaped my growth as both a developer and a teammate. Last summer I volunteered with a Santa Ana food-pantry collective that struggled with volunteer no-shows. I led a small student crew to build a lightweight scheduling site and integrated Twilio texts that ping volunteers 24 hours before their shift. The no-show rate dropped from about 40 percent to under 15, and weekly distributions finally ran on time.

Having been part of launching ViTAL Hacks as a new healthcare-focused initiative, I know firsthand the energy and potential that comes with building something from the ground up. There's something special about being able to shape foundational practices and help establish a culture that will define an organization's future success. What draws me to Generate is your focus on creating tailored solutions, from predictive models to intuitive dashboards, that address real organizational challenges. This requires both technical skill and genuine understanding of what stakeholders actually need, which I'm eager to develop through hands-on client work. Your emphasis on iterative processes grounded in feedback and experimentation really resonates with how I approach problem-solving.  Through organizing hackathons, I've learned that the most meaningful solutions come from staying close to end users rather than developing in isolation. Generate's commitment to working closely with clients and iterating based on their needs complements well with my belief that data science should create real value for real people. As someone who wants to work in computational biology eventually, I see this as an ideal place to develop skills in translating complex analytical insights into clear and actionable recommendations.","I'm strongest when it comes to building and implementing data pipelines and database systems that support solid analytical workflows. Working on Coopalytics really strengthened my foundation in MySQL optimization, real-time data processing, and creating architectures that can handle complex operations efficiently. That project taught me how crucial it is to design data infrastructure that keeps performing well as datasets grow and user demands increase. Building custom REST APIs also showed me how to create systems that seamlessly connect raw data storage with analytical applications. However, I know I need to get better at dashboard design and data visualization beyond the functional analytics I built for Coopalytics. While I can build effective data pipelines and extract meaningful insights, I want to improve my ability to create intuitive, interactive visualizations that make complex findings accessible to people without technical backgrounds. My drive to keep learning actually started pretty early with my obsession with Football Manager. Spending hours analyzing player statistics and market dynamics taught me that data really does tell stories; finding undervalued opportunities through careful analysis and then watching those insights prove accurate was incredibly rewarding. That same excitement about uncovering patterns and seeing predictions validated motivates me to tackle real-world challenges today. The prospect of building models and pipelines that drive actual organizational impact gives me that same intellectual satisfaction while creating tangible value.","Gradient Boosting really captures how I approach complex problem-solving because of its iterative improvement methodology that mirrors how effective learning actually works. Instead of trying to build one perfect model, Gradient Boosting creates a sequence of models where each new one learns from and corrects the mistakes of the previous ones. This has taught me to value continuous refinement and adaptive learning over trying to get everything right immediately. This methodology has shaped how I tackle analytical challenges by encouraging me to see errors and suboptimal results as learning opportunities rather than failures. During my research with Transformer algorithms, I applied this thinking when optimizing model architectures—systematically identifying areas of poor performance and developing targeted improvements through hyperparameter tuning rather than starting over with each iteration. What makes Gradient Boosting particularly valuable is its focus on learning from mistakes and its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in data while still providing interpretability through feature importance analysis. This iterative improvement mindset is crucial for client work because it enables systematic refinement based on feedback and changing requirements. The methodology's emphasis on continuous learning and adaptation corresponds with Generate's collaborative approach, where solutions evolve through ongoing dialogue with clients rather than being delivered as static, one-time outputs.","My research and analytics experiences have really shaped how I understand the connection between technical rigor and practical impact. During my research work, I developed a deep appreciation for methodical experimentation and validation processes while learning to communicate complex statistical concepts to faculty teams with very different academic backgrounds. This taught me to adapt my communication style based on the audience while keeping technical accuracy, for example, presenting the same findings differently to a computer science professor versus a business executive with no technical expertise. Working in real estate analytics was particularly eye-opening because it showed me how data-driven insights create measurable business value. I learned to move beyond just generating reports to creating analyses that directly informed strategic decisions and contributed to quantifiable outcomes. This experience really drove home the importance of understanding organizational context and stakeholder priorities when designing analytical approaches. Seeing how my work contributed to actual growth metrics reinforced that even the most sophisticated analysis means nothing without proper alignment to real-world goals. These experiences have fundamentally shaped how I approach technical challenges, not as isolated problems to solve, but as opportunities to create meaningful value for real people and organizations. This perspective resonates strongly with Generate's mission of delivering client-focused data solutions through collaborative, iterative processes.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=f418771d-7c58-4340-92ab-a9bc3e576fd6","646c586a652aa6ed28fafa79ebb76862"

From leetcoding endlessly to making countless projects for each new AI tool, it's this passion that connects every programmer to the same journey. My personal drive is to impact. Whether it's through my research in farmworker mistreatment or industry work in reducing recruiter workload through custom LLMs, I always ensure my work helps streamline lives.  That’s where Generate comes in, Northeastern’s premier product development studio, a place where members empower innovative ideas from even more innovative minds. What draws me specifically to Generate is the chance to join that transformation early: to be part of a team that doesn’t just build for the sake of it, but builds with intention, feedback, and purpose. Especially with the new Data Science branch, which reflects that mindset, embedding analysts into cross-functional teams to drive decisions with insight to craft smarter, more adaptable products.  Products like Alia, a Generate alumni now disrupting the Shopify popup space, truly show the kind of thoughtful, high-impact work Generate supports. I’m eager to bring my skills in data and product thinking into an environment where innovation is grounded in values, and where students don’t just contribute, they lead.","If drive is what pushes a builder forward, skill is what gives that drive direction. One technical skill I’ve developed confidence in is building data pipelines, from cleaning and structuring messy inputs to deploying scalable systems that power real-time analysis. I’ve used this skill across research and industry: engineering a resume parser backed by a custom LLM, or building a backend to analyze farm labor datasets for policy insights. In every case, I’ve learned that great data work doesn’t start with the model; it starts with the infrastructure behind it. That said, I’m eager to grow my abilities in product-focused experimentation, particularly A/B testing and user analytics. Understanding how real users interact with tools and being able to quantify and act on that is a skill I know will make my work more thoughtful and user-centered. What motivates me most is impact. I learn best when the stakes are real and the outcome helps someone, whether that’s streamlining a recruiter’s workflow or helping a startup make better product decisions. Challenges don’t deter me; they energize me. Every gap in my knowledge is just a signpost pointing toward what’s next, and I’m always ready to follow it.","In data science, it's easy to chase the newest model or algorithm, but the methodology that’s shaped me most is HITL learning. At its core, HITL emphasizes collaboration between humans and machines, reminding us that AI doesn’t have to be a black box; it can be a dialogue. There’s a lot of fear surrounding AI: fears of job loss, of ethical failures, or of machines replacing human judgment. I believe the best way to ease that fear is by building tools that put people at the center of the loop. When I used HITL frameworks to refine LLM-based interview tools or improve data quality in policy research, it wasn’t just about accuracy; it was about trust. When users can shape a system, they’re more likely to understand it, adopt it, and see its value. This philosophy now guides my approach to every project. I don’t just want to build something that works; I want to build something people believe in. HITL reminds me that data science should be empowering, not intimidating. That’s the kind of work I want to keep doing, bridging the gap between fear and functionality, and showing how AI can make our lives better, not harder.","While I haven’t been a part of Generate yet, my experiences so far have taught me the value of building with purpose and building with people. At Johnson & Johnson, I work on a fast-moving scrum team where each sprint is a lesson in communication, iteration, and user-focused development. Whether I’m engineering scalable ETL pipelines or optimizing our cloud infrastructure, I’ve learned that great technical work starts with understanding the problem and ends with improving someone’s experience. Outside of industry, research has grounded me in impact. From analyzing farmworker mistreatment using national labor datasets to training models that detect malaria-infected cells, I’ve seen how data science can drive policy, healthcare, and public understanding. And through my past internships, I’ve worn multiple hats: shipping LLM-based resume analyzers, working on backend API systems, and translating stakeholder needs into usable tools. These experiences have shaped me into someone who values thoughtful, collaborative problem-solving. I’m not just excited by the code, I’m excited by the why behind it. That’s what draws me to Generate: the opportunity to build with intention, surrounded by people who are just as passionate about bringing bold ideas to life.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=d5403442-faeb-448b-9499-db7384150dd5","5ed3fac508573f124d86d274fd3dffb3"

While other organizations focus on either technical skills or business development in isolation, Generate offers the complete journey from ideation to implementation. As someone who has already transformed data insights into tangible business value at Dico and optimized real-world logistics at UNIGIS, I'm drawn to Generate's mission of empowering student ventures that create lasting change. My current research, as a co-op student, at the Network Science Institute, analyzing millions of USPTO patents to uncover collaboration patterns, has shown me the power of data in revealing hidden opportunities. Combined with my upcoming MIT certification in Data Science and Machine Learning, I'm eager to leverage these skills to help Generate ventures make data-driven decisions that accelerate their growth. What excites me most is Generate's collaborative ecosystem where technical expertise meets entrepreneurship. I want to contribute my data science skills to help fellow students transform their innovative ideas into successful ventures, while also learning from diverse perspectives across disciplines. Generate isn't just about building skills, it's about building solutions that matter.","I'm highly confident in my ability to process and analyze large-scale datasets. Through my current co-op at the Network Science Institute, I've become proficient in handling tens of millions of rows from the USPTO database, using pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for pattern recognition, and creating meaningful visualizations that reveal hidden insights. This skill proved invaluable at Dico, where I transformed customer behavior data into actionable strategies that improved marketing efficiency by 17%. One skill I'm eager to develop further is deep learning for predictive modeling. While I've started exploring PyTorch in my current research, I want to master neural networks to build more sophisticated models that can predict innovation trends and collaboration outcomes in complex datasets. What motivates me to continuously learn is the thrill of solving increasingly complex problems. Every new challenge, whether optimizing bus routes with graph theory or predicting tennis court availability, teaches me that there's always a more elegant solution waiting to be discovered. The intersection of theoretical knowledge and real-world impact drives me forward. When I see my code reduce delivery times by 15% or help students find available tennis courts faster, I'm reminded that technical skills aren't just abstract concepts, they're tools for making life better","My favorite data science methodology is the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, not just because I implemented it to solve my high school's bus routing problem, but because it fundamentally changed how I approach complex optimization challenges. ACO mimics how ants collectively find the shortest path to food sources through pheromone trails, demonstrating that simple rules can emerge into sophisticated solutions. This nature-inspired approach taught me that the best solutions often come from understanding the problem's inherent structure rather than forcing rigid frameworks. When I applied ACO to redesign our school's bus routes, achieving a 14% reduction in travel time, I learned that sometimes unconventional methods yield breakthrough results. ACO has shaped my problem-solving philosophy: start simple, iterate constantly, and let patterns emerge from the data. In my current USPTO research, I apply this mindset by first understanding the natural networks of collaboration before imposing complex models. Rather than immediately jumping to advanced neural networks, I build incrementally, just as ants strengthen successful paths over time. This methodology reminds me that data science isn't just about applying the latest algorithms; it's about choosing the right tool for the right problem. Sometimes, inspiration from a colony of ants can revolutionize how an entire community commutes.","My professional and extracurricular experiences have shaped me into someone who thrives at the intersection of technical innovation and community impact. Leading as Director of Engagement for the LATAM Business Club taught me that bringing people together around shared goals creates exponential value, a lesson I apply when collaborating on technical projects like TenniSync, where we're not just building an app, but solving a real campus problem. My internships at UNIGIS and Dico revealed how data science can transform entire operations. Reducing delivery times by 15% wasn't just about optimizing algorithms, it was about understanding drivers' daily challenges and making their work more efficient. This human-centered approach to technology defines how I tackle every project. Working across cultures, from Mexico City to Boston, has taught me that the best solutions emerge from diverse perspectives. Whether I'm debugging code with the Electric Racing Club or analyzing patent networks at the Network Science Institute, I've learned that innovation happens when technical expertise meets genuine curiosity about different viewpoints. These experiences have instilled in me a core belief: technology should serve people, not the other way around.

That really stood out to me because it showed that Generate offers more than just skill-building — it creates real-world impact and professional growth. I’m drawn to how it brings together people from different disciplines to turn ideas into tangible outcomes. As someone passionate about using finance to support innovative projects, I’m excited by the chance to contribute meaningfully while learning alongside a thoughtful, driven community.","One technical skill I’ve developed and feel confident in is Excel. I’ve used it extensively for financial modeling, budgeting, and data analysis, and I’m comfortable with advanced functions like VLOOKUP, PivotTables, and conditional formatting. I enjoy how dynamic Excel can be when solving real problems and organizing complex information clearly. A skill I’d like to continue improving is SQL. While I’ve used it to extract data and conduct basic queries, I want to get more comfortable with optimizing queries and working with larger datasets. What motivates me to learn and take on new challenges is the excitement of solving problems more efficiently and being able to contribute more meaningfully to a team. I enjoy pushing myself to figure things out and become more self-sufficient, especially when I know those skills can directly support others and improve outcomes.","One data science methodology that stood out to me during my MISM course last semester was K-means clustering. It was one of the first times I saw how unsupervised learning could uncover hidden patterns in large datasets without any predefined labels. We applied it to segment users based on behavioral data, and seeing how the algorithm grouped similar users by minimizing intra-cluster variance completely changed how I thought about data analysis. Rather than jumping straight to assumptions or predefined categories, I started approaching problems by first exploring how the data naturally clusters and what those patterns reveal.  K-means taught me the value of letting the data speak, which has shaped the way I frame questions and extract insights, especially when working with large or ambiguous datasets in SQL or Excel. It showed me that strong analysis is not just about running numbers but about asking thoughtful questions, exploring creatively, and interpreting findings in context. This approach continues to influence how I solve problems and work through real-world scenarios.","Although I haven’t been part of Generate before, my professional and extracurricular experiences have shaped me into someone who thrives in collaborative, impact-driven environments. I’ve taken initiative in building things from the ground up on campus, including starting and scaling organizations that connect students across cultures and interests. These experiences taught me how to lead with purpose, stay adaptable, and think strategically while working with diverse teams. Professionally, my roles have ranged from research administration to financial analysis and operations, each sharpening my ability to manage details while keeping the bigger picture in mind. I’m drawn to Generate because it mirrors the kind of environment where I do my best work — one that challenges me, values intention and community, and encourages growth through hands-on problem solving.","I’m excited by the opportunity to thrive in a community that values structure, intention, and collaboration and Generate truly embodies that.

After finishing my first semester, I researched more about Generate, and it really sparked my interest. Although I come from a biology and IT background, I’m still figuring out how well I fit in, but I’m eager to try. I want to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with students from different fields, and improve my skills in solving biological problems through data. I see Generate as a great opportunity to learn by doing and grow both technically and personally.","I come from a pharmaceutical background with over 10 years of experience and recently transitioned into bioinformatics, which blends biology and computer science. I’m still learning and getting comfortable with the tools, but I’ve been making steady progress. One skill I’m growing confident in is using Python, especially pandas, to clean and explore biological datasets. It’s exciting to see how much insight data can provide. I want to improve my skills in machine learning—particularly building and evaluating models, which I’ve just started exploring. Even though I’m not yet fully proficient, I’m a fast learner and committed to growing. What motivates me is the idea that these skills can help solve real problems in healthcare and beyond.","During the last semester, I gained hands-on experience with several computational tools related to Python, Linux, and bioinformatics. In Python, I used libraries like Pandas for data handling.In Linux, I used the command line to navigate directories, manage files, and run scripts. I practiced commands like grep for text and data processing. I also learned to write simple Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks.We were introduced to High Performance Computing (HPC) environments and job schedulers like SLURM to run computational jobs efficiently. I also learned about containerization tools such as Docker and Singularity, which help in creating reproducible and portable workflows.","I haven’t been part of Generate before, but my past experiences have taught me the importance of collaboration, adaptability, and curiosity. I worked in pharmaceutical R&D for several years before coming to Northeastern, where I often led projects with cross-functional teams. Since starting my MS in Bioinformatics, I’ve taken on new challenges learning programming, volunteering in a research lab. These experiences have helped me stay organized, learn from feedback, and adapt quickly to new environments. I want to continue growing through hands-on, team-based experiences like Generate where I can contribute, learn, and help others do the same.","I’m still fairly new to the data science and bioinformatics space, coming from a pharma background, but I’m really excited to learn and grow through hands-on experience.

I experienced this firsthand while working on the Data Solutions team last spring. What stood out to me the most was how Generate’s commitment to intentionality and interdisciplinary work was reflected in every project, meeting, and event I was part of.  Before joining, I was drawn to Generate’s commitment to product development and continuous growth. But after being part of the data solutions team, my ‘why’ changed. Generate has become a place where I have worked with people from all different backgrounds, disciplines, colleges, and more. It is the most diverse organization I have been a part of during my time at Northeastern, and I feel inspired by the common bond members find in our work ethic, intentionality, and commitment.  Generate is set apart because of the people, not just the projects. Members are encouraged to go beyond rubrics and requirements. I am excited by the opportunity to be part of a group of people who constantly push the limits of what is expected of them to create lasting impacts on our clients and teammates.","As a rising fourth-year Data Science and Economics major, I’ve grown confident in my ability to analyze data and tell stories with it. Through my courses, co-ops, and time on Generate’s Data Solutions team, I’ve developed strong skills in analyzing data to deliver insights to different audiences. At my co-op with The Boston Globe, I built dashboards and analyzed subscriber behavior, presenting findings that informed decisions for numerous other teams. In Generate, I worked in a client-facing role where I processed raw data and built a user-friendly dashboard tailored to our client’s needs. This experience reinforced my confidence and enjoyment in simplifying complex data to help teach others.  One skill I would like to expand is my fluency in Tableau. While I used Tableau during my Data Solutions project, I know there is a lot left to learn. I am eager to gain more hands-on experience with building dashboards that can cater to any audience. Working on projects that help real people and create a meaningful impact is what motivates me the most. I enjoy teaching and collaborating with others to translate their ideas into something valuable.","One of my favorite data science methodologies is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). I have learned about its technical utility in reducing dimensions, and also the general mindset it promotes about creating clarity from complexity without losing the bigger picture. In data analysis, it is easy to get overwhelmed by complexity and high-dimensional datasets, but there are ways to create simplicity without erasing meaning from your work. Learning about PCA and its technical applications also taught me a new mindset I could use while working with others.  When creating a dashboard or sharing data with others, my goal is always to simplify information as much as needed for my client’s knowledge level without sacrificing the parts that matter most. PCA has taught me that compression can create clarity in chaos without losing the bigger picture, which is especially relevant in client-facing roles, where I have worked within Generate, co-ops, and other extracurriculars I am a part of.  PCA has shaped the way I think about problem-solving by encouraging me to think about truly understanding the whole, then identifying the most important pieces and drowning out the noise. This has helped me to be a better teacher and communicator, especially towards clients with less technical knowledge."," Being part of Generate has been one of the most formative experiences of my time at Northeastern. I’ve had the chance to work with some of the most driven, intentional, and spirited people I’ve met in college. Through Generate, I’ve grown as an analyst, teammate, and student. What makes Generate stand out is its culture. I’ve always felt supported and valued by those inside and outside of my team. Whether you’ve formally met or not, people are eager to offer guidance and collaborate. I’ve consistently felt encouraged to step outside of my comfort zone without feeling alone. Generate has always made it feel safe to take risks and grow. I feel lucky to have been part of such an empathetic and intentional community. I’ve learned to ask for help when I need it, offer support when I can, and always strive to go above and beyond. These lessons have stuck with me beyond Generate. I’m incredibly grateful for what this community has given me, and I’m excited for the opportunity to continue growing within it, and look forward to giving back however I can.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=7b9e164a-4296-4905-8ace-ba8e4a895fa0","81993121c4f67eba937b3a534f2ab3ca"

As a Software Engineer Co‑op at NExT Consulting, I’m gaining firsthand experience designing and prototyping solutions in a consulting environment, aligning technical decisions with client goals and iterating based on feedback. Earlier, as a User Experience Designer, I worked in a consulting capacity to deliver a high‑fidelity prototype that directly improved a non‑profit’s event platform, teaching me the importance of listening, adapting, and delivering with impact.  My technical work reflects the same mindset. In Personal Portfolio Manager, I built an AWS‑based data pipeline to clean, process, and analyze portfolio data. In NU‑CLEAR, I developed a Python and Flask system for collecting and filtering co‑op feedback so students and advisors could make better decisions. Both projects took messy, real‑world data and turned it into actionable insights.  Generate’s mission of creating innovative, feedback‑driven solutions aligns perfectly with how I already work: iterating fast, collaborating openly, and ensuring the end product truly serves its users. I see Generate as the ideal place to grow my technical skills while continuing to make an impact.","One technical skill I’m confident in is building backend systems that are scalable and easy to work with long‑term. In projects like NU‑CLEAR and my work for Northeastern’s Student Government Association, I’ve built REST APIs, structured databases, and designed architectures that can grow without becoming a mess. I’ve gotten good at thinking ahead so the code stays clean and maintainable, not just functional in the moment. A skill I want to improve is my ability to work with machine learning algorithms. I’ve built data pipelines and done analysis, but I want to get better at selecting, tuning, and applying models to solve different types of problems effectively. What pushes me to learn new things is knowing I’ll be able to solve real problems better. I like being thrown into situations where I need to figure things out fast, because once I do, I can use that skill on every future project. Challenges keep me growing, and I like seeing that growth show up in the quality of my work and the value I bring to a team.","The data science methodology that’s influenced me the most is CRISP‑DM. This was always the way I worked through those phases in my projects, even before I knew the methodology had a name. I always started with understanding the problem, then collecting and preparing the data, building something that works, and finally delivering it so people can actually use it.  I saw this play out in the Personal Portfolio Manager, where we had to figure out what insights users needed first, then design an AWS‑based pipeline to clean and store their data before running any analysis. The process was exactly the same in my RAG system project. We start by understanding the question, preparing the text data, choosing the right retrieval setup, and finally making sure the output was meaningful.  What I like about CRISP‑DM is that it gives structure without being too rigid. This not only prevents me from coding before I’ve nailed down the problem, but it also reminds me that delivering something useful is just as important as building something technically impressive. That approach has shaped how I tackle every data project: methodically, but with room to adapt as I go.","My professional and extracurricular experiences have set me up to thrive in a collaborative, fast‑moving environment like Generate. As a Backend Software Engineer for Northeastern’s Student Government Association, I worked on a TypeScript and NestJS system for nominations and application tracking, plus an internal attendance manager in Next.js and Prisma, making sure everything was reliable by thoroughly testing changes before deployment. In NU‑CLEAR, a co‑op feedback platform, I built a Python and Flask REST API with MySQL, deployed in Docker, so users could filter and analyze feedback in real time. In Catalyst, I wrote algorithms to turn complex degree audits into clear, actionable guidance for students. These projects taught me how to take messy requirements and turn them into scalable, maintainable solutions while working closely with teammates. Outside of coding, being Webmaster for Northeastern Robotics and a Khoury Teaching Assistant has helped me get better at explaining complex ideas and working across different disciplines. I’ve learned that the best solutions come from rapid iteration, openness to feedback, and genuine collaboration, values I’m ready to bring to Generate while continuing to grow as a software engineer.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=1652328c-1e12-44b2-9979-8491be4c3185","407d7095cec6ac36fc2275a3af66d8ff"

After attending many social and technical events over my last semesters, I’ve always been consistently impressed by the creativity and collaborative spirit of its members and the energy of everyone in the club. Regardless if you’re in Community or Data, everyone is welcoming and working toward the same cause - making sure that the members of Generate are growing and learning from each other. Even with directors and chiefs who may seem distant, they aren’t - this strong sense of connection and inclusion remains central to how Generate operates. Generate is special because it allows members to immerse themselves in an environment that makes learning and being career driven a reward because you spend time working on a challenging and meaningful project with teammates that eventually become close friends. And when Showcase rolls around, it highlights the best of what we do in Generate - seeing every team's hard work and creativity. It’s a reminder of how much you can accomplish with talented people who become both colleagues and friends. ","One technical skill I am confident in is data manipulation using SQL and Python. I have experience handling large datasets, performing complex queries, and transforming data to extract meaningful insights, directly supporting business decisions in my current co-op. In the meantime, I want to tap into deep learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch to tackle complex healthcare problems like medical image analysis and predictive health. The ability of deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in messy, unstructured data can go beyond what traditional methods can achieve. I’m excited to further explore this in my Machine Learning II course in the Spring, where I'll strengthen both mathematical and practical foundations in ML. I’ve always been motivated to power innovative solutions for preventative care, even as a non healthcare professional. I figured out early on that data science could be my way of making a meaningful impact. Using a combination of creativity and problem-solving in data science that requires both ability to build accurate models and storytelling to drive real-world action always keeps me constantly engaged.","One of my favorite data science algorithms is Principal Component Analysis because of the way it handles dimensionality while still preserving meaningful patterns. The first time I ever attempted  to understand it was when I was working on analyzing gene expression matrices to identify marker genes. From there, I was intrigued by the math behind being able to transform more than a thousand features into a couple of principal components without losing information in what appears to be untouchable data. Yet, it somehow can be as interpretable in a simple elbow plot. Using PCA as an example, I approach problem solving in a way to simplify complexity without losing signal in the midst of messy and complex data. When working with manipulating thousands of database records, loaded with nulls, unknowns, and hundreds of attributes, I apply a similar mindset; I sift through the noise to uncover meaningful patterns in the data that would have gotten lost, enabling cleaner and effective modeling and analysis. ","Being on the first ever data client team, I know first hand how  complex and unpredictable working with a client can be. Yet despite all the obstacles the team and I faced during the semester, we managed to deliver a product we were proud of. I learned how to collaborate with a stakeholder, adapt to limitations (like working solely with Google Sheets), and quickly pivot/troubleshoot (like switching to Google Sheets API). Despite all that, showing up in the corner room of the Sherm after a long day of co-op and still being able to laugh -even while pumping out a few more lines of code - was one of the most rewarding parts of my week.   Two semesters later, I’m still extremely close to those who I’ve formed connections with on my time as an Events coordinator, and even more so the amazing people who I worked with on Eatwell. Even then, I loved meeting people in other branches/fields that I normally never get to see as a data science major. Generate played a pivotal role in my third year, and I’m eager to continue building those meaningful experiences into my fourth year.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=0a51c42c-ef3b-4099-9b83-9bc2ecc05ba6","5983d9092ac33986450c3371654704a0"

While most clubs only have speaker events or workshops, I think Generate will allow students like me to apply themselves further by contributing to projects that are needed.","One technical skill that I am confident in is using scikit learn's supervised learning algorithms such as random forest or linear regression to build predictive models. I experimented with multiple models, tuned parameters to estimate student's exam scores based on a list of factors like hours studied, school distance from home, and parental involvement. One skill that I would like to learn and improve upon is creating dashboards or interacive data visualizations because I think it can help communicate results to any user and would be useful for developing real world products. I always enjoy learning because I'm motivated to use my skills to eventually have a positive impact on the world. I believe when I learn and challenge myself, my skillset will grow and I'll be able to help more in different ways. For example, right now I'm working on developing NLP policy impact tool, where the program would analyze the text in a bill or document, and analyze whether they would help or hurt certain groups.","One of my favorite influential figures that uses data science is Esther Duflo.She is an economist that uses randomized controlled trials to analyze and improve policies involving poverty such as school programs and microloans.

I’ve seen the incredible work from friends already involved in Generate and am inspired not only by their ability to apply a wide range of skills while developing new ones through meaningful projects but also by the sense of community they’ve described. The combination of the work they do and the time they spend on Thursday nights connecting with teammates is something I’m especially excited about. This balance between tackling challenging projects and building relationships creates an environment where everyone supports and grows with one another.  I’m eager to contribute my experience in data science, backend development, and AI. Especially from my recent work building REST APIs, accelerating data queries for financial dashboards, and applying natural language processing for education. I’ve worked on both client-facing and research-based projects where turning raw data into actionable tools made a true impact. In the Data team, I’m excited to deepen these skills by designing pipelines, visualizing insights, and experimenting with models. Above all, I want to grow in a place that values community, real-world experience, and building with purpose.","One technical skill I’ve developed and feel confident in is data querying and backend integration. While interning at Acadia, I redesigned PostgreSQL queries that supported Power BI dashboards for major financial institutions, reducing run times by 99%. I’ve since built on that experience through backend development at ZOR!, where I designed REST APIs to handle real-time health and environmental data from iOS devices. These experiences taught me how to build data systems that are both efficient and reliable.  One skill I’d like to improve is building and deploying machine learning models in production environments. I’ve studied ML concepts in Harvard’s Artificial Intelligence with Python course which covered search algorithms, classification, and probabilistic reasoning. I’ve also applied NLP techniques in a MATLAB research project. I now want to take the next step by working with real datasets to train, test, and iterate on models that deliver meaningful insights to users.  What motivates me most is solving complex technical puzzles. I really enjoy being able to break down a problem or situation into something solvable and refined. Being able to combine my love for engineering and AI with a possibility to make a change is another motivating factor I have. I love the idea of bringing both passions of mine together.","My favorite data science methodology is dynamic programming because it perfectly reflects how I love breaking down complex problems into simpler, manageable parts. Dynamic programming solves problems by dividing them into overlapping subproblems and building solutions step-by-step, avoiding redundant work. This efficient approach aligns with my passion for solving technical puzzles in AI and engineering.  For example, Hidden Markov Models, which are widely used in sequence modeling and prediction, rely on dynamic programming algorithms like Viterbi to find the most probable hidden states efficiently. Similarly, Constraint Satisfaction Problems also use dynamic programming in order to break down large search spaces into constrained smaller problems making them solvable.  I apply this mindset broadly in my work to understand problem structure, refine better solutions, and optimize through mistakes and feedback. Dynamic programming has shaped the way I approach problems by encouraging efficient, scalable solutions. This approach motivates me to deliver impactful results and fits well with Generate’s mission of combining innovation and real world problem solving.","While I haven’t been in Generate yet, many of my experiences mirror its mission of building real solutions through collaboration and iteration. At ZOR!, I’m currently designing backend systems that connect health and environmental data for epilepsy monitoring. I’ve worked across both iOS and Flask environments to build scalable, real-time APIs that balance technical rigor with user needs.  During my firmware co-op at Evident Scientific, I helped test and validate embedded systems for aerospace safety tools. I learned how to debug deeply technical issues while communicating across hardware and software teams. At Acadia, I combined SQL optimization and Power BI dashboarding to deliver faster insights to financial institutions, and also helped prototype and document an internal AI chatbot.  This past spring, I joined Forge, a student-led product development club, where my team built a company-wide fitness platform called MOOSEMENT. I contributed heavily to backend development, helping implement a Flask-based REST API for user authentication, challenge tracking, and leaderboards. Being able to be a part of a team with students from all different skillsets and backgrounds who are passionate was an amazing experience. I hope to be able to do something similar to Generate and bring my passions to a community driven space.

Generate offers a one-of-a-kind experience to help startups build their product from the ground up while collaborating with peers who are just as passionate about learning, growing, and building together.   During my first co-op, I interacted with early-stage startups and saw how they aimed to leverage data to grow their brand. However, I didn’t get the chance to support them directly. Then last semester, I helped develop ClaimCrisis during the Finnovate challenge, which made me realize how much I want to apply my data science skills to bring a startup idea to life. That’s why Generate stood out to me because it’s where I can apply and grow my skills while working closely with real clients.   Finally, I’m drawn to the multi-team environment. Most of my past work has been solo or in small pairs. So the chance to build alongside engineers, designers, and analysts excites me. Generate offers a space where I can learn from others, grow through feedback, and work toward shared goals. It feels like the kind of environment where I’ll be challenged, supported, and genuinely excited to work.","One technical skill I'm confident in is building forecasting models by identifying and developing the most impactful features. During my co-op, I created a student enrollment model that went beyond our historical data. I explored the enrollment pipeline to identify the strongest predictors, performed exploratory data analysis, and ran correlation tests to hypothesize new features that may influence enrollment, such as F1 visa wait times. Through the iterative exploration and hypothesis testing, I created a custom yield rate methodology that led to 77% model accuracy. One skill I want to improve on is fine-tuning models. There is always room to maximize performance, so I want to explore new modeling techniques, such as model stacking, and learn how to apply different tuning strategies, and better understand how each adjustment impacts accuracy.  What motivates me to take on challenges is my curiosity. I’m driven by the desire to understand how processes work and uncover patterns that shape outcomes. For example, that mindset led me to investigate the potential link between F1 visa wait times and enrollment. For me, learning is most meaningful when it starts with questions I genuinely care about and that curiosity keeps me motivated to explore open-ended problems.","The data science methodology that shaped my work is CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). Three takeaways that continue to guide me are: starting with a deep understanding of the business, iterating across stages to refine assumptions, and planning for long-term model usability. I was introduced to CRISP-DM by a co-worker during my co-op, where I was tasked to build a student enrollment forecasting model. Instead of diving into historical data, I spent a month meeting with teams to understand the enrollment process and define the business problem. Only then did I begin exploring data, running correlation tests, and identifying key variables. As I iterated through data understanding and preparation, I revised my hypotheses and re-tested features.  Finally, it’s easy to assume a model is complete if it’s accurate. However, it’s important to plan for model maintenance. That’s why I created documentions, walkthroughs and updated systems to ensure the model remains usable after my co-op. These three takeaways reshaped how I approach problems. I now prioritize understanding the business context before touching the data, iterate consistently to refine predictors and always document my work. This mindset helps me not only chase accuracy but design solutions for longevity.","  Last semester, I participated in Finnovate, where my team developed ClaimCrisis, a startup idea designed to help families file insurance claims after natural disasters. We started as a team of five, but within four weeks we became a team of three. I knew I had to push myself, take on new responsibilities like task tracking, and help restructure how we worked to keep the project alive. What shaped me wasn’t just our product but how we adapted together. We juggled multiple tasks, from reaching out to nonprofit organizations to insurance research. Our ideas shifted multiple times as we uncovered gaps, which required us to stay flexible and open to change. These experiences taught me that adaptability isn’t just about adjusting your workflow but also your mindset. When we faced setbacks, it was choosing to stay positive, trusting each other, and embracing the uncertainty that pushed our work forward. This project stretched me beyond what I was used to. It challenged me to lead in unfamiliar situations, take initiative, and stay open to changes. ClaimCrisis became a reminder to me that growth happens when I’m uncomfortable and that some of the most fun and rewarding experiences come from facing challenges.

The opportunity to work in teams with other people on real world problems with actual clients I think presents a chance for me to learn a lot about applying data science to practical scenarios. Those kinds of skills that I will need if I want to work in computational biology or any other intersection of biology and computer science because of the messy nature of biological data and the variety of domain specific knowledge from different experts.","One skill that I think that I have developed well is algorithm optimization and computational efficiency. By being a CS 5800 TA and through my wikiGame project I’ve had to work making sure that solutions scale and are as efficient as they can be.  One skill that I would like to develop more is in the realm of advanced machine learning, more specifically feature engineering and model interpretability. I have experience building models but I want to deepen my understanding of model explainability techniques, feature selection methods, and how to actually extract useful insights from these black boxes.","I think that dimensionality reductions (and the manifold hypothesis more generally) have shaped my perspective by making me more aware of the trap of trying to include too many variables. It’s been known for a long time that simple models with less parameters generalize bette, despite this there is a tendency to want to include more things in models as we learn more about the systems we are studying and understand of more effects/forces that could impact results we include more parameters into our models to improve accuracy. The thing is most of said parameters are not important, and especially in biological systems where there are so many possible interactions its important to find a way to remove the unnecessary components not only for pragmatic reasons like ease of implementation but because these smaller models actually do generalise better.","I think that my time at Sanofi has shaped me greatly by also reinforcing some of the ideas I have from dimensionality reduction. My work involved developing an assay (a kind of test) to determine certain properties of our process. I had to systematically control and understand the effect of a variety of different variables and I often found the greatest success (not just immediate but also the most generalisable) in the most limited scenarios with the least amount of free variables. I think that even though we have a great understanding of some of these systems the noise that arises when we include more variables can create a lot of uncertainty, and I take that “incrementalist” approach to many problems.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=2b0c5e24-0f60-4e5d-9288-64f4c2e22a04","9f007707fe9f8b6ee93d37c46d90ddab"

What stood out to me most was how she emphasized the importance of not just building intelligent systems, but building them responsibly and with a strong understanding of both business and user impact. Her ability to bridge deep technical expertise with real-world applications and policy influence helped me realize that data science isn’t just about models and metrics. It's also about communication, scale, and ethical responsibility. Hearing her speak motivated me to be more intentional about the problems I work on, and to approach data science as a tool for creating scalable, human-centered solutions.

I recently learned how important it is but don’t have much experience in this area, so I am interested in learning more about it. I enjoy the process of learning new things and taking on challenging work. I’ve found that the most rewarding aspects of a project for me are the ones where I have no idea what I’m doing, but somehow figure out a way to solve the problem. I always end up reflecting the most on those moments and growing from them more than any others, which is why I enjoy taking on challenging work.","I really like the logistic regression algorithm because it's a very simple algorithm, but it is so effective in many different scenarios. It’s easily one of the most useful and versatile algorithms in data science, and is the foundation for a lot of machine learning and more advanced algorithms as well. It makes me think about how the simplest solutions can sometimes be the best. Whenever I try to solve a problem, I always look for the simplest solution first and then try to fine-tune or modify it as needed. In my role as planning and scheduling coordinator for Aaroh, I had to find a way to track our members’ attendance. In my first semester in the position, I wrote down the time that everyone was expected to be at practice in the notes app on my phone, which was the simplest solution I could think of. This approach was effective, but I improved it further in the next semester. I started tracking attendance on a google sheet, which provided much more versatile tracking and actually allowed me to enforce other rules more effectively.","For the past year, I served as planning and scheduling coordinator of NU Aaroh, a music club at Northeastern. In this role, I was responsible for ensuring our events ran smoothly, which ironically taught me that something will inevitably go wrong at any event. I learned that the best way to deal with a problem like this is to maintain my composure to find methodical solutions. This ability to stay calm under pressure directly applies to client work at Generate, where meeting deadlines and managing client relationships require the same level-headed approach to problem-solving. This role also taught me the importance of planning ahead. Last year, our leadership team frequently found ourselves scrambling to finalize event details at the last minute.

That’s what draws me to Generate. I really admire how it lets students build and practice skills within their own disciplines while collaborating across fields. I haven’t come across any other org on campus that offers such an experience. ","I’ve built strong core skills in leadership, communication, and especially in making clear, visually appealing presentations. It’s something that’s always come naturally to me and something I’ve used a lot in past projects. What I want to work on is applying my data science skills in hands-on situations. I’ve done the academic stuff, but I haven’t had many chances to actually build things or work on industry-level problems. That’s the part I’m missing and really want to grow in. I won’t lie, challenges usually feel pretty overwhelming when I first face them. But I literally can’t walk away from them. If I don’t figure it out, it just sits in my head and bugs me. So even if it takes a while, I always push through, and once I do, that “wait I actually did it” feeling makes it 100% worth it. That’s what keeps me going.","This took me a second to think about, but I think I’m going to go with a simple answer. Merge Sort. It’s a fairly basic algorithm but I like its divide-and-conquer approach which basically mirrors how I tend to work with challenging tasks. When something feels overwhelming, I’ve learned to just break it down and tackle one part at a time. I also think it’s cool that its time complexity stays consistent no matter the case, it handles everything smoothly without surprises (from my experience, at least). And it’s audibilization is lowkey a bop, if that helps makes my case. It’s simple but reflects my approach to solving problems. ","I haven’t been in Generate before, but I think it’s such a cool concept and the vibe of the org really reflects me and my career aspirations. As a sophomore, I’ve had some independent and academic experience in data science, but I’m ready to take that to the next level by collaborating with others and applying my skills to acual projects. Generate feels like the perfect opportunity to do that. One of the things I really love about Generate is how it brings together students from all majors, because I’m interested in work that lives at the intersection of two very different but important fields, data science and ecology. I’ve worked on projects in the past that combine both, and I’m excited to bring that perspective to Generate. In my past academic projects, I’ve noticed that whenever we hit a block and things aren’t working, I’m usually the one who sparks discussion and helps bring the team toward a solution. I want to bring that same energy to Generate by sharing what I know and learning from others.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=455649d5-1baf-44f9-9c0b-5d23c6d07dd0","14da68d491ca1205269662a4a3ea51f6"

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to collaborate alongside other like-minded and driven students while building innovative and impactful solutions for Generate’s clients. In addition, Generate’s focus on Organizational Identity stands out to me as it emphasizes creating a strong sense of belonging and fostering meaningful connections within teams. This aligns perfectly with my desire to be part of an environment that values feedback and continuous growth. Additionally, after speaking with current and former Generate members, Generate has consistently stood out. They frequently highlight how Generate’s commitment to empowering its members and the clients they collaborate with has significantly contributed to both their personal and career growth. The opportunity to apply my teamwork, innovation, and technical skills to real-world innovation and entrepreneurial support makes Generate the ideal organization for me. Overall, I am confident I would thrive at Generate, contributing to a driven and spirited team, collaborating on innovative projects, and fostering a community of growth and success.","One technical skill I have developed and am confident in is exploratory data analysis. In all of my projects, whether they are machine learning or analytics projects, I employ Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to uncover trends and gain a deeper understanding of the data. This critical process has strengthened my ability to manage and interpret complex datasets, communicate project insights more effectively, and lay a strong foundation for implementing more advanced data techniques.  Something I am eager to learn more about is deep learning. Having gained exposure to and built projects with both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, I’m excited about the opportunity to understand and implement deep learning in the future. In particular, I’m keen to delve into Large Language Models and how they can be implemented to tackle complex business problems in all types of industries.  Curiosity and drive are the core motivators behind my passion for learning and embracing new challenges. The rapid evolution of technology has intensified my curiosity, inspiring me to explore its underlying mechanisms. This drive to practically explore how things work fuels my commitment to continuous learning and motivates me to develop innovative strategies that contribute to solutions.","My favorite data science methodology is Supervised Machine Learning because it offers a powerful balance between guidance and adaptability. Working with labeled data enables me to train models with clear objectives and measurable outcomes, an approach that aligns closely with how I like to execute projects. During my Uber Fare Prediction project, I used supervised learning models such as regressions and decision trees to understand what metrics affect Uber pricing. This experience taught me how to critically think about what features to use, how data could bias predictions, and how to evaluate model performance in the context of the project’s objectives. More importantly, the principles behind Supervised Machine Learning have shaped the way I approach problem solving both independently and in team settings. Much like refining a model through iterations, I’ve adopted a mindset of continuous improvement, learning, and optimizing to deliver the most effective results. Additionally, Supervised Machine Learning has taught me to maintain quality in every stage of work just as models trained on poor data result in weak predictions, thoughtful preparation and attention to detail are essential for producing meaningful outcomes.  ","  My experiences as a Data Analytics Co-op at Insulet and a Data Analyst Intern at Sports Data Now have shaped both my technical and interpersonal skills in numerous ways.  At Insulet, I collaborated with a team of primarily non-technical engineers, strengthening my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, a critical skill when working with various groups. This experience also broadened my perspective on how data-driven solutions can create value across different functions, sharpening my critical thinking by pushing me to consider not just how to build solutions, but why they matter in the context of team and company goals. One key project involved designing a scalable database and creating data pipelines, which helped me understand diverse viewpoints, while enhancing skills such as project planning and execution.  My experience at Sports Data Now, a startup focused on sports betting data, was also pivotal, as it was my first technical professional experience and laid the foundation for my understanding of technical principles and how software engineers and data analysts collaborate to drive business outcomes. The fast-paced and dynamic nature of the startup specifically shaped how I work, strengthening my ability to adapt to different projects, changing priorities, and shifting responsibilities.","N/A","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=741d6610-fb0b-44cd-b10f-f23b8e644bc7","0834af6eeb59f149ad842a0ee347b1fa"

Sometimes when trying to solve a problem, we get so bogged down in details that we forget to define our goals. When you can clearly define and quantify the few key criteria for a solution to a problem, that alone halfway solves it. Then, you can find a whole population of solutions that each are strong in their own way and pick the one that best suits your priorities. ","In my co-op doing Research at Boston City Hall, my work is very project-based, which has really improved my ability to manage complex tasks as a team. In addition, the work involves understanding complex datasets and being able to clean, filter and aggregate them properly to produce precise results.

Unlike other student organizations, Generate provides a startup-oriented environment where I can apply my technical skills to build meaningful products alongside passionate peers. I’m drawn to its focus on hands-on, interdisciplinary collaboration, working with designers, engineers, and product thinkers to solve real problems. This fast-paced, startup-like culture is exactly where I want to be because it simulates an environment where I might find myself after I graduate. By building projects from idea to product, I can learn at an accelerated and effective rate that no other organization can provide. It is a valuable experience and skill to execute these plans, and I'm excited by the opportunity to grow not only as a developer but also as a team member who contributes to impactful products.","In my programming career, I have focused the majority of my attention on backend, including learning languages like Python, Java, and C++. Most of the projects I have done use these languages, and I would say all three of these languages are at about the same level of proficiency. Additionally, I believe these skills are vital to any project that today's tech industry demands, and fairly confident that I can deliver these skills to the team. One technical skill I would like to learn and work on is the frontend, specifically web development, and how I can create immersive, modernized websites for clients' needs. Backend implementations are the most difficult part of programming, but none of it will matter if we can't bridge the functionality of our application with our users, which is why I believe frontend is an important skill to have for all developers. What motivates me to learn is the fact that I am not satisfied with where I want to be as a developer. I think of it as a game, where you can level up infinitely by engaging in multiple learning development situations to earn learning points. The more learning points, the better you become at the game.","One of my favorite methodologies in data science is gradient boosting, particularly through frameworks like XGBoost. Its ability to build strong models by correcting the errors of weaker learners has deeply influenced how I approach problem-solving: break down complex tasks into smaller steps, learn from failures, and incrementally improve the solution. In my own projects, including predictive modeling and ML pipelines, I’ve seen firsthand how powerful this approach is when paired with thoughtful feature engineering and evaluation. It goes to show that effective solutions often come from refining simple ideas, not from complexity alone. By dissecting the process into smaller bits and refining those areas individually, it can produce more effective and descriptive systems and solutions that best fit the needs of the user.","During my internship and personal projects, I had the opportunity to work in fast-paced environments that challenged me to learn quickly and collaborate effectively. I learned new tools, frameworks, and engineering practices while building solutions that delivered real value to users.

Also, I think this will be an incredible opportunity to exchange knowledge with some of the most hardworking and driven students at Northeastern. I would love the chance to share what I know, while also learning from others who are just as passionate about tech and innovation.","As a data science student and former data analyst co-op, I am confident in my ability to ask questions about messy data and extract number-backed insights that can drive change. I have learned this skill by working with ambiguous data, being forced to think outside of the box, and thinking critically about both the problem and the broader context surrounding it. I truly think the world runs on data, and I strongly feel that I can ask the right questions and understand the algorithms that unlock data’s true potential.  One area I’d like to grow in is AI/ML software development. I’ve noticed that the current data science curriculum often lacks depth when it comes to programming and engineering principles. I want to build a stronger foundation in how data science is integrated into software to create AI/ML-based products. I feel like this is the standard for the future of tech, and I believe that mastering software development will enable me to really make the most of any data available. Knowing that the challenges I take on today are building the skills I’ll use to solve meaningful problems in the future keeps me excited, focused, and eager to grow.","My favorite data science algorithm is K-Means Clustering because it highlights how ""high-tech AI"" often is just a computer-based version of something humans do intuitively: grouping similar things together. When I first learned this algorithm, I was struck by how a thought process could be translated into math and code, and how a skill all humans are born with can be translated and taught. That realization was monumental for me. It not only opened my eyes to the vast possibilities of machine learning but also revealed how its core ideas often stem from simple, human logic. Now, I see AI and ML as reflections of how we think, amplified by technology and processing power. If there’s something I know how to do, there’s likely a way to translate that skill into programming. It reminds me that with curiosity, time, and a thoughtful approach, I have the potential to build solutions to almost anything I can imagine, and the applications are nearly limitless.","In my previous co-op, I led multiple projects where I was responsible for core reporting and data analysis. Taking ownership of these deliverables required me to explain my work to stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds, which helped me develop strong communication skills and the ability to tailor my message based on each audience. Success in this role proved to me that I’m capable and knowledgeable, and as a result, I no longer hesitate to share insights when they are valuable. Working as a TA for DS2500 has also deepened my ability to collaborate with other technical students. I have learned how to fill knowledge gaps without taking over work, focusing on guidance and shared understanding. As Director of Member Development for my sorority, I focus on encouraging academic and personal growth. This includes helping members find balance between academics, career goals, and their personal lives. Supporting others in this way has improved my own time management, prioritization, and ability to set boundaries when situations become overwhelming.

I'm comfortable connecting frontend UIs with functional systems using various databases and frameworks. I'm comfortable with relational and document-based databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, backend programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, programming frameworks such as Express.js and Spring Boot, and services such as Docker and Postman. A technical skill I'd love to expand on is frontend development. I want to become more proficient at CSS and styling frontends to be presentable and professional-looking. Good UX is important for user engagement, and my backend focus sometimes leaves projects functionally solid but visually dull. Understanding modern frameworks, responsive design principles, and UI/UX best practices would allow me to develop complete applications users actually enjoy interacting with rather than merely functional ones. Having the chance to develop more complete, UI/UX-focused solutions motivates me to develop skills further. Satisfaction in creating something which actually makes a difference to users motivates me to learn complementary skills.","A role model I look up to in the field of data science is Alan Turing, whose contributions have influenced the way I solve challenging problems today. Studying the Turing Machine in PHIL 1145 enabled me to change my approach to problem-solving since his model showed me that any large problem can be simplified into small, discrete steps. Whenever I face a difficulty implementing an algorithm or an analytical problem, I've learned to break down the issue into basic operations. The Turing Test was one of the concepts that sparked my interest in machine learning. It inspired me to think about models that not only give good results, but are also able to communicate the results they obtain effectively to its users. Whether I'm experimenting with building predictive models or creating data visualizations, I always think of how these concepts and ideas can play into what I am doing. Ultimately, what I admire the most about Turing was his idea that computation could systematically manipulate information, helping lay the foundation for modern data science.","My internship experience at Observe.ai, a Series C startup, transformed my entire perspective about software engineering success. Working on long-term projects provided me with real-world complexities that academic assignments cannot replicate, teaching me how to work with customer requirements, team collaboration, and technical work to user demands. Through his mentorship, my manager showed me that technical abilities do not represent the complete picture. He embedded the notion that learning is always ongoing and emphasized that building relationships, daily progress, and effective communication are equally important. My focus began to shift from trying to learn everything to one that prioritized developing strong interpersonal skills and maintaining a progressive growth mindset. The experience demonstrated to me that software engineering should be about developing products which create positive impacts for others. The experience of watching technical work produce meaningful results made me understand my future career goals. The internship revealed that engineers who succeed beyond technical skills must be team-oriented problem solvers who develop solutions for users. I will maintain this perspective by focusing on continuous learning, effective communication, and positive impact to create meaningful work in my next team.

Learning about the shoulders of giants we stand on always leaves me in awe. The more I learn the more I want to be part of a similar groundbreaking advancement, and I believe that data science would be my gateway. I always strive towards that goal and see Generate as an excellent opportunity to be part of something bigger than myself. Being able to surround myself with incredible people and working on innovative and creative projects sounds like a perfect opportunity and incredibly rewarding. The biggest thing I hope to gain from Generate is the community and the irreplaceable experience. Learning from other similar students of all concentrations and having a structure for personal and professional growth is a major step in realizing my dream.","One technical skill I've gotten really comfortable with is being pragmatic about solutions. During my co-op, I had a habit of spending way too much time refactoring code or building overly complex solutions when what we already had worked perfectly fine. Learning to ship clean, tested features without chasing perfection has been vital for me. It's made me a much more effective team member. Something I want to get better at is building stronger technical intuition. I'm confident with the mechanics of coding, but I want to develop that deeper sense of knowing which approach will work best before I even start implementing. Being able to quickly assess trade-offs and anticipate potential issues is the kind of intuition I see in developers that I admire. That's exactly what drives me to keep learning new things. During my co-op, I realized most of my time wasn't actually spent writing code but figuring out what to build in the first place. Whether I was designing endpoints or components, getting those reps in and starting to recognize patterns has given me so much more confidence when I hit a new problem. In a field that changes this fast, that kind of intuition is more valuable to me than just memorizing syntax.","It's no secret how influential artificial intelligence has become in all disciplines, especially computer and data science. Ashish Vaswani is regarded as one of the godfathers of modern AI through his groundbreaking work on transformer technology. Through his research, he demonstrated how a more focused approach with simpler architectures could outperform their more powerful and complex counterparts. What really resonates with me about Vaswani's breakthrough is how it challenged everything we thought we knew about processing sequential data. His team didn't just tweak existing methods. They completely rethought the problem and showed that paying attention to what matters most could beat brute force complexity. Sometimes I feel the urge to build the most cutting-edge and complex solution because it feels cool and exciting. But Vaswani's work reminds me to ask what's the simplest approach that could actually work here? In my own projects, I've started applying this mindset by focusing on the key signals that drive results rather than getting lost in elaborate pipelines. Just as he proved, a simpler and more targeted approach can achieve fantastic results while being more efficient and maintainable.","I used to think teams were just a means to get things done more efficiently, but seven years on my high school robotics team taught me to challenge that perspective. Teams aren't just about dividing up work. They're about creating something none of us could build individually. The biggest lesson came during our most challenging seasons when the robot kept failing and competitions kept happening. I learned that stepping back and genuinely listening to everyone's concerns was far more valuable than just pushing through problems. When people felt heard and understood, they started contributing better ideas and working with real investment, not just obligation. I found myself spending significant time facilitating discussions and keeping us aligned on our core objectives. It wasn't always straightforward, but building that foundation of trust and open communication made us substantially stronger as a team. We transformed from a group of individuals into a cohesive unit that could navigate any obstacle. At Generate, I want to bring that same collaborative mindset. The strongest solutions emerge from environments where people feel comfortable proposing ambitious ideas and building on each other's contributions. I'm excited to help foster that kind of environment where everyone's input strengthens the final outcome.","","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=9a485092-1274-4e89-8172-52e934d2e06d","7b9cda9105e592c01eb90a3e3438e2dd"

A place where people don’t just build for the sake of it, but care deeply about what they’re creating and who they’re building for. That’s the mindset I’ve developed through my work at InstaLily AI and with Speakl.ai. At InstaLily, I saw firsthand how software can directly improve someone’s day-to-day work. And with Speakl, I’ve been part of something from the ground up. Identifying a real gap, building around user feedback, and learning to ship with purpose. Those experiences made it clear to me that I love building, but more importantly, I love building with intention. Generate stands out because it’s more than just a place to code. It’s a team of people who care about craft, collaboration, and impact. I want to grow alongside people who think like that, who challenge each other to build smarter and kinder. I’m excited by the idea of contributing to real projects, learning from talented teammates, and creating things that actually matter. That’s what I hope to be part of at Generate.","One technical skill I’ve grown confident in is backend development. After working on real-world systems at InstaLily AI and building out infrastructure for Speakl.ai, I’ve learned how to design APIs, manage data flow, and deploy to the cloud in a way that’s scalable and reliable. It’s become second nature to think about how systems connect and how users will interact with what’s under the hood. That said, I really want to improve my frontend skills, more specifically creating smoother, more intuitive user experiences. I’ve realized that no matter how strong the backend is, if the interface doesn’t feel right, users won’t connect with the product. I want to be able to contribute across the stack and bring that full vision to life. What keeps me learning is honestly just curiosity. I love the feeling of solving problems that once felt impossible and seeing ideas go from sketch to shipped. Taking on challenges is exciting because it means I’m growing, and I’m someone who genuinely enjoys the process as much as the outcome."," One concept in data science that really stuck with me is active learning. I came across it while building a resume screening tool at InstaLily AI, and it completely changed how I thought about training models. The tool was designed to help hiring teams prioritize top candidates by ranking resumes based on experience, relevance, and domain fit. Early on, I realized we didn’t just need more data,  we needed smarter ways to decide which resumes were most valuable to label and learn from. That’s when I started exploring active learning. Instead of feeding the model a giant labeled dataset, I built a loop that identified the resumes it was most uncertain about, then sent those to human reviewers for feedback. This made the model better, faster, and way more efficient over time. It showed me how important it is to work with your data, not just throw more of it at the problem. Active learning helped me approach machine learning like a conversation: you ask questions, learn from the answers, and get better with every round. That mindset has stuck with me in every project since, and it's why I love this space so much."," Ever since I joined InstaLily AI, I truly understood the meaning of building with a purpose. As a company, InstaLily is all about the clients and developing to make operations more efficient for them. Time and time again talented developers build with no intention which leads to products that may seem cool, but don't actually close a gap or solve a need. After witnessing the real-time impacts my development at InstaLily had on the client's growth, I had a new found drive to make a difference. These experiences taught me to develop inclusively, intentionally, and measure success by user impact. I no longer see the use in building a project that shows I can code, I'd rather build something that shows I can produce with the intention of closing a gap. This led to my development of Speakl.ai, an AI powered speaking coach that revitalizes the speaking process and helps individuals find THEIR voice. Speakl.ai, isn’t an effort to show off my technical skill, rather it is a reflection of my understanding there are so many gaps that exist and I wanted to build something that can help do that. ","I don’t just love building, I care deeply about why we build. Whether it's for a user, a team, or a real-world need, I’m always chasing impact over output, and I’m excited for the opportunity to bring that to Generate.","None","https://build.fillout.com/editor/pSwDKG3CCHus/results?sessionId=c3771468-ba7e-4516-88a8-187352fdc6f7","57b7d78ed5a7dabb446e9004b45057ab"

I’ve explored data analytics in both the financial sector and education—using Excel to analyze heavy position holdings at a securities research firm, and using Python with Selenium to scrape and organize data from Northeastern’s course transfer database for faster course matching. The Data Member position is where I hope to build on these experiences and deepen my technical skills. I enjoy working with complex datasets and uncovering insights that translate into real-world decisions. Generate’s project-based structure offers the kind of hands-on, team-driven environment I’ve been looking for.","One technical skill I’ve developed is 3D modeling—especially with Rhino, which I consider the best tool for industrial design. In my Cornerstone of Engineering course, I created all the prototypes for my team’s design and often led the structural problem-solving process. I work quickly and think modularly to allow flexibility during testing, always aiming to stay one step ahead in design logic.  While I’d love to contribute to the hardware team at Generate if possible, I’m currently focused on growing my skills in data engineering—specifically in SQL. Stronger SQL skills would help me extract and organize information more efficiently, and that’s something I’m excited to train through real projects at Generate.","My favorite data science concept is simulation modeling, which I’m excited to explore more deeply in the upcoming semester as part of industrial engineering. I’m drawn to it because it removes guesswork—by building the right assumptions and using real data, you can make sense of complex systems. During my internship at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities, I assisted my mentor build a net profit evaluation model across turbine components. It showed me how even messy, nonlinear systems can become navigable with the right tools and structure. That experience shaped how I approach problems today: model first, test assumptions, and refine based on results. ","","I have an idea for an on-campus self-driving delivery robot project. I’m currently in touch with the technology owner, who has detailed data and statistics backing the concept, and I’ve already shared my idea with them—they’re interested in moving it forward. I’m wondering if this project could be evaluated through Generate and potentially developed into a school-year initiative. I think it would be an exciting opportunity to create something impactful and visible on campus.
